U.S. growth may be continuing to slow, but athleisure retailer Lululemon reported strong sales cross its international markets, notably China, leading to a 9% increase in sales year-on-year.

The news and a subsequent surge in share price means it is trading around a quarter higher this month, although still nearly 21% off in the year-to-date. However, after some self-inflicted own goals over the calendar year, the yoga apparel retailer looks as if it has turned the corner.

It results exceeded Wall Street expectations as it said revenues hit $2.4 billion against the $2.36 billion expected and were 9% up on the year, with the company’s net income for the quarter ended Oct. 27 at $352 million, compared with $249 million.

But sales also told a tale of two markets, with its domestic and U.S. markets continuing to see slower sales growth, while international and especially Asia have provided new sales growth channels.

For the crucial holiday period, Lululemon anticipates revenue to be between $3.48 billion and $3.51 billion, representing overall growth of 8% to 10% from the prior year, roughly in line with analyst guidance.

Lululemon Holiday Sales

However, Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald refused to get carried away and was at pains to stress a note of caution over the company’s fourth-quarter outlook.

“While we feel good about the start of the holiday season, we still have large volume weeks in front of us. Given the shorter holiday shopping season, we continue to be thoughtful in our planning for quarter four overall,” he told analysts on a call.

Perhaps that caution is understandable. Lululemon has had a challenging year and while it has made its own missteps, the competitive environment has only grown more intense, with newer disrupters such as Vuori and Alo Yoga taking market share from the Canadian retailer. Add to that the U.K.'s Gymshark recently announcing its intentions to ramp up its U.S. operations and 2025 will only become tougher.

In addition, Lululemon got its supply chain for a high-profile product launch wrong earlier this year and missed out on sales in the U.S. when it failed to offer the range of colors and sizes that its core customers desired. When the company reported earnings in August, McDonald insisted that the brand remains strong in the U.S., but conceded that its women’s business had slowed because it had not provided enough new styles to attract customers.

Lululemon China Sales

As a result, the company has turned to China for growth, which so far has helped lift sales across the overall business and because of that company-wide comparable sales grew 4% during the quarter. However, there was a 2% slowdown in comparable sales in the U.S., against a 25% increase internationally. Overall revenue grew 2% in the Americas during the quarter and 33% internationally.

Yet while this in encouraging, the Americas remain Lululemon’s largest markets by far, and international is still a fraction of its overall revenue. So while growth is positive, that will need to translate to sales in the longer term.

“Our teams have been agile and have been chasing into seasonal colors, prints and patterns. I’m sure you’ve seen several examples across our key franchises,” said McDonald of the lessons the company has learned. “These efforts have contributed to the sequential improvement in newness within our assortment in the back half of the year...we continue to see significant potential for growth in the U.S.”

In the meantime, Lululemon has turned to stock buybacks to keep Wall Street onside. It approved a $1 billion increase to its stock repurchase program this month and it has approximately $1.8 billion remaining in the program.

But with the reporting network realigned and any of its problems apparently behind it, Lululemon looks much better placed for a strong Christmas than its CEO is letting on."

Customers love promotions. Think about it: there’s nothing better than seeing that your grocery store is having a BOGO sale on your favorite cereal. Is the deal ‘limited time only’? Before you know it, you’re probably stocking up on items you weren’t even intending to buy.

As suppliers, promotional pricing comes with its own challenges. While it’s a great strategy to adopt when you’re looking for increased sales, a competitive edge or better brand awareness, promotional pricing is not without some risks. To do it right, there are a few things that suppliers should keep in mind.

What is promotional pricing for suppliers, and why should my brand do it?

Promotional pricing is a strategy that suppliers use to achieve a specific business goal. That goal varies depending on the current supplier strategy.

Boosting sales

When suppliers want to increase their sales in a short period of time, promotional pricing can attract more customers and encourage them to make purchases they may otherwise delay or skip.

Inventory management

Suppliers may use promotional pricing when they have excess inventory, especially for old or seasonal items.

Market penetration

Lower prices can help suppliers reach new markets and are a good starting point for acquiring new customers.

Competitive edge

When there’s a lot of competition, suppliers can use promotions to gain an edge in the market and increase market share, especially with customers who are more sensitive to high prices.

Enhancing retailer relationships

Promotional pricing with retailers strengthens relationships and could lead to more shelf space, more favorable terms and more opportunities for collaboration.

Customer loyalty

Suppliers who offer discounts are more likely to see repeat customers who appreciate a good deal. If suppliers do promotional pricing with any type of regularity, customers may develop a preference for that brand.

This all sounds great. Why would any supplier not want to offer promotional pricing from time to time?

As with any good supply chain strategy, promotional pricing can be a complex process to get right. Eroded profit margins, brand devaluation and unrealistic customer expectations are just a few of the risks associated with promotional pricing that’s done incorrectly.

Risk #1: Eroded profit margins

If suppliers offer promotional pricing too often with no significant increase in sales volume, they run the risk of eroding their profit margins.

Risk #2: Brand devaluation

Constant promotions can lead customers to believe that the brand is low quality or make the decision to only purchase items when there is a discount.

Risk #3: Operational strain

When suppliers offer promotional pricing, they will most likely see sudden spikes in demand. Without the proper supply chain setup, however, they may struggle to keep up with the influx of orders.

Risk #4: Inventory shortages

When promotional pricing is too successful, it can lead to inventory shortages, which disappoints customers and damages the supplier’s reputation.

Risk #5: Market oversaturation

If there’s too much promotional pricing, the market becomes saturated, which makes it difficult for suppliers to generate interest in future promotions.

How can suppliers navigate promotional pricing in a way that works with their supply chain strategy?

Though the line between good promotional pricing and bad promotional pricing can be thin, there are some strategies that are available to help suppliers decide when and how to offer discounts. It’s important for suppliers to zero in on exactly what they’re looking to gain by offering promotional prices.

First, suppliers should analyze historical data of past promotions by looking at inventory levels, promotional prices, discount percentages and sales lift to create a solid sales plan for the next promotion.

Collaboration with trading partners should be another priority for any supplier looking to offer discounted prices. They’ll be able to confirm inventory quantities and demand to ensure the correct promotional pricing is offered.

Once the promotion is running, it should drive customers into the store to purchase the items at a discount while also leaving with other items in their basket.

With the help of the right technology, you can find the perfect balance for promotional pricing with capabilities like analyzed and actionable sell-through data insights, streamlined item, pricing and other data, and inventory visibility for trading partners.

2,2024-12-09 00:00:00,Descartes Releases December Global Shipping Report: November 2024 U.S. Container Imports Show Softer Seasonal Decline,"ATLANTA —

Georgia, December 9, 2024 -- Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq: DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, released its December Global Shipping Report for logistics and supply chain professionals. In November 2024, U.S. container import volume decreased 5% from October 2024, which is consistent with seasonal month-over-month declines seen in previous years, though smaller than the 9% decrease over the same period in 2023. Imports from China also declined, though November volumes are 13.3% higher than the same month in 2023, underscoring the continued strength of U.S.–China trade. The December update of the logistics metrics monitored by Descartes continues to demonstrate the strong performance of container imports in 2024; however, the potential introduction of new tariffs by the incoming Trump administration, stalled ILA/USMX contract negotiations, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East may put pressure on global supply chains throughout the balance of the year.

At 2,368,758 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), November U.S. container import volume dipped for the first time in four months below 2.4 million TEUs—a level that previously led to port congestion and delays during the pandemic. Versus November 2023, volume in November 2024 was higher by 12.8%, and up a significant 24.6% from pre-pandemic November 2019. Notably, total imports for the first 11 months (25,829,192 TEUs) of 2024 have already surpassed the 12-month total (24,957,640 TEUs) for 2023—by 871,552 TEUs or 3.5%.

“November has traditionally been a softer month than October; however, compared to the past six years, this year’s month-over-month decline is the smallest by volume (down 125,877 TEUs)” said Jackson Wood, Director, Industry Strategy at Descartes. “While front-loading shipments due to heightened uncertainty around labor unrest and tariffs is a possibility, U.S. container import volumes have been exceptionally strong over peak season this year and, overall, robust throughout 2024.”





The December report is Descartes’ fortieth installment since beginning its analysis in August 2021.

Getty Images Syrians may be celebrating the fall of Assad, but the country's future is uncertain

In the end the Assad regime was so hollow, corrupt and decayed that it collapsed in less than a fortnight. No one I have spoken to has been anything other than astonished by the speed with which the regime turned to dust. In the spring of 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, it was different, when Syrians tried to grab some of the revolutionary magic that had swept away the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt and was threatening the veteran strongmen of Libya and Yemen. By 2011, the regime created by Hafez al-Assad and passed to his son Bashar on his death in 2000 was already corrupt and decadent. But the system that Hafez built still had much of the brutal, ruthless strength that he believed was necessary to control Syria. Assad senior had seized power in a country that was prone to coups and delivered it to his son and heir without a significant challenge.

Bashar al-Assad went back to his father's playbook in 2011. It is hard to imagine now, but back then he had more legitimacy among some of Syria's population than the old dictators swept away by crowds chanting the slogan of that year - ""The people want the fall of the regime"". Bashar al-Assad was a vocal supporter of the Palestinians and of Hezbollah during its successful fight against Israel in the 2006 Lebanon war. He was younger than the ex and soon to be former Arab leaders. Since his father's death he had been promising reform. Some Syrians still wanted to believe him in 2011, hoping demonstrations were the spur he needed for the change that he had promised, until he ordered his men to shoot peaceful demonstrators dead in the streets. A British ambassador in Syria once told me that the way to understand the Assad regime was to watch Mafia films like The Godfather. The obedient could be rewarded. Anyone who went against the head of the family or his closest lieutenants would be eliminated. In Syria's case that could mean the gallows, or a firing squad, or indefinite incarceration in some underground cell. We're seeing them now, emaciated and pale, blinking into the light, filmed on the mobiles of the rebel fighters who have freed thousands of them from years behind bars.

Reuters

The weakness of the regime, to the point that it collapsed like a soggy paper bag, was disguised by the fearsome and repressive gulag it still maintained. The international consensus was that Bashar al-Assad was weak, dependent on Russia and Iran, and presiding over a country he had fractured to preserve his family's rule – but still strong enough to be regarded as a fact of Middle Eastern life, who could even be useful. In the last days before rebels burst out of Idlib, it was widely reported that the US, Israel and the United Arab Emirates were trying to detach Assad's Syria from Iran. Israel had been launching increasingly heavy airstrikes against targets inside Syria it said were part of the supply chain Iran used to get weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel's offensive in Lebanon had dealt severe blows to Hezbollah, but the idea was to stop it regenerating. At the same time the UAE and the US were trying to find incentives for him to break the alliance with Tehran, relaxing sanctions and allowing Assad to continue his international rehabilitation. Both Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden have claimed credit for the fall of the Assad regime. There is something in that. The damage Israel inflicted on Hezbollah and Iran with US weapons and constant support, and Biden's supply of arms for Ukraine, made it impossible, even undesirable, for Assad's closest allies to save him. But the fact that they saw Assad as part of their strategy to contain and damage Iran until days before his fall indicates clearly that they did not for a moment believe him to be days away from a midnight flit to Russia. They did contribute to his end, more by accident than design.

Getty Images The change of regime in Syria has seen many released from the country's prisons

The fall of the regime might have ended Iran's supply chain, if Syria's new rulers decide their deals with others are more useful than the Iranian alliance. All sides are thinking hard and thinking again about what comes next, and it is too soon to draw definite conclusions. Syrians, their neighbours, and the wider world are now confronted by another geopolitical earthquake, the biggest of the series that has followed the Hamas attacks on Israel in October last year. It might not be the last. Iran is seeing the final collapse of the main planks of the network it called the axis of resistance. Its most important components have been transformed; Hezbollah badly damaged and the Assad regime gone. Iran's rulers might want to follow up on hints of talks on a deal with Donald Trump once he takes office. Or its new strategic nakedness might push it into a fateful decision to turn its highly enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon. Syrians have every reason to rejoice. In the years after 2011, for all the repression and brutality of the regime, Assad and his acolytes could still find men who would fight. Many of the troops I met on front lines told me that Assad was a better option than the jihadist extremists of Islamic State group. In 2024, faced by a well-organised rebel force that insisted it was nationalist, Islamist but no longer jihadist, the army's reluctant conscripts refused to fight, stripped off their uniforms and went home.

EPA Syrian troops abandoned military hardware, including tanks, and discarded their uniforms in some cases

The best scenario is that Syrians, helped by the big players in the region, will find a way to create a postwar mood of national reconciliation, not a wave of looting and revenge that will drag the country into a new war. Abu Mohammad al Joulani, the leader of victorious HTS, has called for his men and all of Syria's sects to respect each other. His men have removed the regime, and he is the closest Syria has to a de facto leader. Syria, though, has dozens of armed groups that do not necessarily agree with him and will want to grab power in their own areas. In southern Syria, tribal militias did not recognise the writ of the Assads. They will not follow orders they don't like from the new set up in Damascus. In the eastern desert, the US saw a big enough threat from remnants of the Islamic State group to launch waves of air strikes. The Israelis, alarmed by the prospect of an Islamist state on their border, are pounding the military infrastructure of Syria's armed forces. It might be better to find a way to make a reformed Syrian Arab Army part of the solution in a country without much law or order. The reckless decision by the US in 2003 to dissolve the Iraqi armed forces had disastrous consequences. In Turkey, President Erdogan must be satisfied by what he sees. Erdogan's Turkey did more than any other power to preserve the autonomy of Idlib province, where HTS was transforming itself into a fighting force when Syria seemed to be in the deep freeze. Erdogan might see his influence lapping Israel's borders, at a time when Israel-Turkey relations have been poisoned by the war in Gaza. The worst scenario for Syrians is that their country will follow the example of two Arab dictatorships that spun into violent chaos after the fall of their regimes. Colonel Gaddafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq were removed without a ready-made replacement waiting in the wings. Ill-considered foreign intervention did much to create two catastrophes. The vacuum left by the dictators was filled by waves of looting, revenge, power grabs and civil war. Syrians have not been in charge of their own destiny for generations. Individuals were robbed of it by the two Assad presidents and their followers. The country lost it after war left it so weakened that bigger foreign powers used it to increase and preserve their own power. Syrians still do not have agency over their lives. They might have a chance of creating a new and better country if they did."

8,2024-12-08 00:00:00,Is Your Leadership Ready For The AI-Powered Future Of Business?,"Photo credit getty

Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining how organizations operate and grow. For leaders, this transformation presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Adopting a mindset that embraces continuous innovation is key to overcoming the challenge. AI offers leaders a powerful tool and partner for navigating change, uncovering growth opportunities, and building a future-ready workforce. Those who develop a human centric approach to AI will drive innovation and expand their personal brand.

Leaders who thrive in this environment will move beyond technical knowledge and focus on cultivating a strategic approach to AI integration. Doing so involves leveraging AI to drive better decisions, fostering a culture of adaptability, and preparing their teams to fully embrace its potential. Here's how to get started.

Use AI To Enhance Decision-Making And Uncover Growth Opportunities

ChatGPT and other generative AI tools offer leaders unparalleled insights into operations, markets, and customer needs. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time, AI-powered tools enable leaders to make more informed decisions faster and with greater precision. McKinsey reports that 65% of organizations now regularly use generative AI in at least one business function.

""AI is profoundly reshaping leadership strategies, transforming them from reactive to anticipatory models,"" says Amit Varma, President of Global Markets at Brillio. ""Leaders now leverage AI to enhance decision-making precision and drive operational efficiencies at an unprecedented scale."" Beyond operational improvements, AI can help uncover entirely new revenue streams by identifying untapped markets or creating innovative services. To fully harness this potential, leaders should invest in data governance frameworks that ensure accuracy and consistency to lay the groundwork for AI to deliver actionable insights.

Cultivate An AI Mindset That Embraces Continuous Learning And Adaptability

Lifelong learning is essential for all employees in a rapidly evolving environment. Leaders need to double down on their growth mindset. Traditional leadership models, which often emphasize static expertise are no longer relevant and need to be replaced with approaches that value curiosity, experimentation, and adaptability. Leaders who cultivate data literacy and technological fluency can confidently navigate AI's complexities.

This focus on learning also involves recognizing AI as a complement to human ingenuity rather than a replacement for it. For example, AI tools can augment creativity by generating ideas or automating routine tasks, freeing teams to focus on strategic and innovative activities. McKinsey's latest survey reveals that AI delivers meaningful revenue increases—like over 5% gains in supply chain and inventory management—and drives cost efficiencies in areas like service operations and human resources. By cultivating a culture that celebrates learning and experimentation, leaders can create an environment where AI is seen not as a disruptor but as an enabler of progress.

Prioritize Workforce Readiness To Fully Leverage AI

The success of AI adoption depends not only on the technology itself but also on the people who use it. Building a workforce that is both AI-literate and open to technological change is essential for any organization looking to thrive in the digital age.

Leaders can start by providing training programs that demystify AI and equip employees with the skills to use it effectively. This could include workshops on data interpretation, hands-on experience with AI tools, or even cross-functional collaborations that encourage knowledge sharing.

Creating a culture of openness to change is key. When teams understand the value of AI and see its benefits firsthand, resistance will likely. Leaders can further foster this openness by celebrating milestones and acknowledging employees who embrace AI-driven initiatives, making innovation a shared organizational priority.

Lead With Confidence In An AI-Powered Future

It seems ironic that one of the biggest tech advances in our lifetime -AI- is having its greatest effect on leadership by offering new ways to drive innovation, make better decisions, and build teams that are poised for a tech-driven future. Successful integration requires a mindset shift, a commitment to continuous learning, and a clear strategy for workforce empowerment.

As you reflect on your leadership journey, consider how you can leverage artifical intelligence to adapt to change and drive it. The leaders of tomorrow will be those who embrace AI as a catalyst for growth, guiding their organizations with vision, agility, and confidence. Are you ready to lead in this AI-powered world?

The Two Tone iPhone 17 Pro

Is Apple ready to shake up the look of the iPhone Pro? There is discussion online that Tim Cook and his team are considering a move towards a dual-material design. The iPhone started out with this style but moved to a uniform industrial design in a few short years. Could it move back, and if so why?

""The report says that there will be big changes to the way the iPhone looks at the back on the Pro models. “The back of the Pro and Pro Max models will feature a new part-aluminum, part-glass design. The top of the back will comprise a larger rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass. The bottom half will remain glass to accommodate wireless charging, two people said,” according to The Information.""

The iPad Pro And The M5 Chip

Apple’s current desktop class M4 chipset debuted in Apple’s iPad Pro in May 2024 before arriving on the Mac in October, the first time the Mxx series debuted outside of a MacBook. The M5 may take the same route to market, with noted industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reporting from the supply chain on its planned debut.

""The iPad Pro equipped with the M5 processor is expected to enter mass production in 2H25. The company’s business momentum in 2H25 is anticipated to benefit significantly from Apple’s new product launches.""

(Ming-Chi Kuo on Medium).

Wait For The MacBook Air

Staying with the M4 chipset, when Apple brought it to the Mac laptop, it equipped the MacBook Pro range, but not the MacBook Air. Those needing workstation levels of power were well served, but they remain overpowered for consumers needing a well-rounded machine. That laptop would be the MacBook Air, but you’ll need to wait into the new year of you want the best value for money macOS laptop.

“...the M4 MacBook Air should offer a similar level of ports, similar hardware design, and the new M4 chipset that will provide more power and performance than any other consumer-focused Apple laptop currently on the market. If you have to buy a new MacBook in the holiday sales, be aware that Apple has plans for a cheaper and faster MacBook Air shortly.""

Listening To The iOS 18.2 Update

With the upcoming release of iOS 18.2, Apple will bring a raft of new features to the iPhone—Forbes contributor David Phelan has a look at the change log—but one of the practical updates is to the ability to use AirPods to test hearing, as well as expanding the use of AirPods as medical-grade Hearing Aids to new territories:

""The five-minute test allows adults to identify if they have hearing loss by measuring their ability to hear different frequencies of sound. After completing the test, the results will show a hearing loss classification and recommended next steps. Apple has a support document with detailed information about the feature. iOS 18.2 also expands the ability to use AirPods Pro 2 as a clinical-grade hearing aid to the United Arab Emirates, according to Apple.""

(MacRumors).

Predicting Apple’s Future Portfolio

The broad strokes of Apple’s 2025 hardware follow a similar pattern as previous years—with new iPads, iPhones, and MacBooks—but it’s worth summarising what we can expect over the next twelve months. Michael Burkhardt looks ahead into 2025, including Apple’s smarthome display:

""Apple’s first smart home product with a display is also on track for a spring release, marking Apple’s first HomePod (of sorts) to support Apple Intelligence. It’s expected to be a cheaper display that’s both wall mountable and attachable to speakers. It’ll have a roughly 6-inch square display.""

(9to5Mac).

The iPhone SE’s Biggest Upgrade

Apple’s next iPhone—the iPhone SE—is expected to arrive in March. It brings Apple’s first mid-range release in three years, the first Apple-designed 5G modem, and the next upgrade to Apple Intelligence. At the core of all these updates need one thing. An increase in the power and performance of the SE:

""Most of these handsets will be updated in the first half of 2025, putting even more pressure on Apple’s iPhone SE brand. Given that it has been 1000 days since the last iPhone SE in March 2022, the new SE will need to stay relevant for a similar three-year window, and the specs will need to leapfrog over the Android-powered competitors by some distance.""

(Forbes).

And Finally

Apple Music Replay started this week, a data-driven look at each subscriber’s musical tastes in the last twelve months (co-incidentally, the similar Spotify Wrapped recap also launched this week). Apple’s version of the viral spark addresses many concerns from last year’s version to improve the experience:

""Apple finally addressed the biggest complaint about its version of Wrapped: it takes you out of the Music app and onto the web where signing in is required. That’s still true in some instances (the Mac and Vision Pro for example), but the Music app on iPhone and iPad presents the full Replay experience without leaving the app.""

Dive Brief:

S&S Activewear added over 200 robotic picking systems to its distribution centers in Reno, Nevada, and Reading, Pennsylvania, in a bid to increase speed and accuracy of customer order fulfillment, according to a Dec. 4 press release.

Together with Geekplus and Körber Supply Chain Software, the apparel and accessories distributor deployed a Geekplus “PopPick System” that leverages autonomous mobile robots, mobile racks, tote-based storage and an automated picking and replenishment module, John Santagate, SVP of robotics at Körber Supply Chain Software, said in an email.

The added automation aims to help S&S Activewear grow at scale, CTO Brian Beale said in an email. The robots also limit strenuous aspects of warehouse operations, such as operating a forklift.

Dive Insight:

S&S Activewear first deployed the PopPick System in its Lockport, Illinois, distribution center, resulting in operational efficiencies that the retail distributor expects to see in its Reno and Reading facilities.

“Since deploying the PopPick system in our Illinois distribution center, we’ve not only seen production rates jump from 40 picks per hour to 150 picks per hour and a drastic increase in picking accuracy, but turnover has also decreased by 75% as many of the typical warehouse safety risks have been reduced or eliminated,” Beale said in a statement.

Not only has the automation helped the company keep up with demand and increase accuracy, but it also provides customers with much quicker turnaround times, according to the release.

The robotic system used by S&S Activewear is known as a goods to person system, according to Santagate. The robots store totes full of product on mobile racks and when an order is dropped for a particular SKU, the system locates it on the floor area. A mobile robot is then dispatched to fetch the rack and shuttle it to a picking station, where a robotic arm extracts the tote from the rack and presents it to the picker.

Both distribution centers in Reno and Reading house 2,750 racks storing 110,000 totes, according to the release.

The market for mobile robots has become a bigger part of several company strategies. Robotic picking-systems can help company’s not only optimize warehouse operations through higher production output, but expedite delivery times.

Staples, for example, in early 2024 deployed a RightPick system that grips items of various shapes, sizes, weights and packaging. The system is expected to help the company offer next-day delivery to over 98% of the United States."

Dive Brief:

Best Buy customers can now schedule deliveries of small products up to seven days in advance, CEO Corie Barry said on a Nov. 26 earnings call.

The capability is currently live in several U.S. markets — including Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston and Atlanta — with a broader rollout slated for next year, Best Buy told Supply Chain Dive in an email. Shoppers in eligible locations can select a two-hour delivery window for their order.

Best Buy said it uses “a few different gig carriers” for scheduled parcel delivery but didn’t specify particular companies.

Dive Insight:

The scheduling option for products less than 50 pounds provides customers with increased convenience, confidence and control when placing an order, according to Barry. It's one of several ways Best Buy has been pushing to strengthen the customer delivery experience.

The electronics retailer announced in August a live tracking feature for in-home delivery and installation of large items like big-screen TVs and refrigerators, for which Best Buy already provides scheduled delivery. The capability gives customers to-the-minute tracking details, including a real-time view of where drivers are during their route. Barry said the capability's ""feedback has been overwhelmingly positive"" from shoppers.

""Not only is this a great experience for customers, it is already starting to lower cost by reducing calls to our customer service teams,"" Barry said.

Additionally, Best Buy rolled out a generative AI-powered virtual assistant earlier this year that can help customers make changes to order delivery and scheduling, among other support capabilities. Late last year, it partnered with DoorDash for on-demand delivery of various consumer electronics."

[+] talk as world leaders gather for the G20 Summit group photo in Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved

When governments borrow from the capital markets, the credit rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings (“Big Three”) issue sovereign credit ratings to guide supply and demand for the bonds. Sovereign credit ratings function like valves in the credit pipeline: the higher the rating, the lower the cost, the faster the transmission to end-users. And vice versa. Are sovereign ratings biased against economic growth in Africa?

Governments have special powers over their subjects. And credit rating agencies have special powers over the governments they rate. Sovereign ratings can impact the country’s entire supply chain of credit, to states, cities, banks, insurers, corporations, small enterprise, infrastructure, educational institutions, and consumers, with knock-on effects for labor, fiscal development and national wealth.

Creditors the world over rely on credit ratings to evaluate and price bonds—some by choice, others by regulation. One sometimes hears investors say they don’t consider ratings, but this view ignores real market dynamics. Credit ratings connect supply and demand to a market clearing price. Most investors are price-takers. The only times prices and ratings decouple are when the whole market disbelieves in the rating, or demand is thin.

Blame Africa, Or Credit Rating Models?

For several years running, the Big Three have serially downgraded African government debt. In response, a coalition of African economic and political leaders has become increasingly vocal about what they consider bias in the ratings. In September 2023, the African Union threw its weight behind a plan to launch a pan-African credit rating agency (now scheduled for mid-2025) to issue its own domestic credit risk ratings and bring a local perspective to the dialogue.

Reuters broke this news. The article said the Big Three deny bias and claim they “follow the same formula across continents.” This summer, a follow-on Reuters article succinctly summarized Africa’s predicament: “optimism has faded, washed away by a deluge of debt.”

Reuters blamed Africa.

After interviewing “dozens” of rating agency employees, ex-employees and large private creditors, and reviewing “hundreds” of pages of legal documents, Reuters said they found no evidence of systemic bias—only a certain unpreparedness to rate poor countries lacking familiarity with credit rating processes.

These justifications strain credulity. The Big Three are global centenarian giants who have weathered many economic cycles, whose annual revenues match or exceed the GDP of some African countries. Neither inexperienced nor under-resourced, they simply run their businesses as they see fit.

Choice Architecture In Credit Models: Hidden Bias

It is factually incorrect to claim no documentary evidence of bias exists. Senior sovereign credit rating analyst declarations on the existence of bias can be searched and found publicly. Moreover, a growing academic literature that documents how Africa systematically overpays for credit access, and how ratings punish Africa while rewarding other countries for investing in capacity, merits more serious attention.

When I was interviewed by Reuters for the article, I raised choice architecture as a source of bias: the gamification of outcomes by filtering out content that could change (bias) the outcome. The journalist did not consider my points “real-world” and chose not to include them.

I shared this blog with Reuters, whose spokesperson commented: We stand by our reporting which fully met our standards for independence, accuracy and impartiality under the Reuters Trust principles.

But choice architecture is a real-world concern for all manner of credit ratings. The Big Three’s defense, that the formula for sovereign ratings is uniformly applied to all sovereign ratings everywhere, is a perfect example. Far from showing consistency or the absence of bias, it illustrates the fallacy of composition, which assumes what is true for one member of a collective (rated sovereigns) is true for all members.

Moreover, it is the diametrical opposite of what I was taught as a Moody’s analyst in Asia before and during the Asian Crisis. We were told positively that culture, history, law and psychology have a role in how borrowers service their debts. We were urged, as analysts, to go beyond personal, social or cognitive biases in order to assess real repayment likelihood. I transmitted this learning in a 2011 manual I wrote for Hong Kong’s first credit rating agency analyst examinations.

Later, working as a Daubert-qualified credit ratings expert in high-profile litigations related to the Global Financial Crisis, I heard many instances where wrongdoing was denied. To reach a clear determination, each case needed to be re-analyzed from scratch to produce an independent rating judgment that could be compared to the original rating agency rating. It was—is—the only way to ascertain rating impropriety, including bias.

Sovereign Credit Ratings And Africa’s Middle-Income Trap

In the 1990s, in tandem with globalization, the Big Three expanded the orbit of sovereign ratings business from the developed to the developing world. By 2003, while Asia was recovering from its financial system crisis and the West piling into a stock-driven bubble economy, Africa was going from strength to strength on multiple indicators of real economic advancement.

S&P and the United Nations Development Programme set out to rate more African sovereigns, to enable them to tap into global private credit channels and extend their growth. The first rated African countries were colonies of France or Britain: South Africa, Tunisia, Mauritius, Egypt and Morocco. Today the total is 33, according to the UNDP.

But from the GFC through the Pandemic, African economies entered a downturn and interest costs rose. Surpluses for fiscal and social reinvestment dwindled. National finances fragilized. Waves of sovereign downgrades followed.

Africa's Middle Income Trap visualized World Bank - World Development Indicators

Too rich for the concessionary financial support of the past, African governments fell back on their limited domestic capital sources. It was a classic middle-income trap, in which the spring-pin of credit ratings, however unintended, worked against Africa’s economic growth.

A Fine Line Between Bias And Discrimination

In 2008, Ghana’s domestic long-term interest rate was 12%. In 2024, it stands at 29.85%. Nigeria’s was 9.75% in 2008, 6.25% in 2010. Now it is 27.5%.

Interest rates are facts.

Between 2008 and 2024, Uganda’s sovereign rating dropped from B+ to B-/B3 (S&P/Moody’s) and Nigeria’s from BB- to B-/Caa1. Mozambique and Kenya’s ratings fell from B+ to CCC+/Caa2. Ghana and Zambia missed payments in 2022 and 2020, and their ratings dropped from B+ to Selective Default/Caa2.

Credit ratings are opinions. An opinion by its very nature has bias. It reflects unconscious emotional or cognitive beliefs, or one-sided judgments. Everyone has biases. Acting on them with selectively negative consequences has a different name: discrimination.

The elephant in the dialogue about sovereign credit ratings in Africa is whether ratings by the Big Three discriminate against Africa. At the end of the day, the answer will not depend on someone’s opinion about bias in ratings. It is a question of whether sovereign credit ratings predict nonpayment risk with measurable accuracy and consistency."

Dive Brief:

Volkswagen Group subsidiary PowerCo SE inked a five-year battery raw materials supply deal with Australia-based Novonix, according to a Nov. 24 press release .

Under the agreement, Novonix will supply PowerCo with at least 32,000 tonnes of synthetic graphite material for EV battery production, starting in 2027.

All materials will be manufactured from Novonix’s Riverside facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which is slated to begin commercial production in 2025.

Dive Insight:

The agreement with Novonix is yet another step toward Volkswagen’s electrification goals.

PowerCo was established by the automaker in 2022 with the intention of boosting battery cell production globally. The company oversees international factory operations, cell technology development and the vertical integration of the battery value chain, according to the press release.

The Volkswagen subsidiary plans to open three gigafactory locations in Germany, Spain and Canada with a combined capacity of up to 200 GWh/year. The factory in Germany is slated to go online first in 2025.

The automaker has also secured other strategic partnerships to advance EV development, including with Rivian Automotive.

In November, the two companies launched a joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology to develop shared electrical/electronic architecture and software for EVs. Additionally, in February, PowerCo and battery startup QuantumScape signed an agreement to mass produce batteries for Volkswagen EVs.

Automakers are pushing to boost battery production to meet electric vehicle assembly needs, prompting a boom of battery material and EV projects in the U.S. despite a slowdown in consumer demand for EVs.

With the Biden administration finalizing tariffs in September for China-made goods — including components for EVs and raw materials for batteries — along with the possibility of additional tariffs under the incoming Trump administration, incentives for domestic battery sourcing have only heightened.

In addition to its Riverside facility, Novonix is planning to build a second battery materials plant in the Southeast to meet customer demand, with a initial capacity of 30,000 tonnes annually. Production will eventually be expanded to 75,000 tonnes a year, according to the press release

Novonix also signed a four-year deal with Panasonic Energy in February for 10,000 tons of synthetic graphite, starting in 2025."

Dive Brief:

FedEx will lay off employees in North Carolina as the delivery giant continues its push to merge its separate Express and Ground networks, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notices filed this week.

The company is permanently closing its ship center in Durham, impacting 123 employees. The company is also reducing its workforce at its Raleigh ship center by 218 employees. Layoffs at both facilities will primarily impact couriers and will take effect Feb. 3.

""Certain team members will be offered opportunities at other FedEx locations,"" FedEx said in an emailed statement. ""Decisions of this nature are the result of much thought and consideration for maintaining the high level of service expected from our customers and other needs of our business.""

Dive Insight:

The closure and layoffs are part of FedEx's Network 2.0 initiative to merge the company's separate Express and Ground operations, a spokesperson said in an email to Supply Chain Dive. In the process, FedEx is cutting facilities and routes that overlap with others.

The overhaul, which aims to save FedEx $2 billion by fiscal year 2027, has seen steady progress. President and CEO Raj Subramaniam said in September that nearly 200 FedEx facilities in the U.S. and Canada will be handling consolidated Ground and Express volume by early calendar year 2025.

""We continue to see roughly a 10% reduction in pickup and delivery costs in markets where we have fully rolled out Network 2.0,"" Subramaniam added. ""Service levels in these markets are meeting or exceeding our network average.""

FedEx is maintaining its service levels despite personnel challenges associated with merging two networks that were long kept separate. Company-employed couriers are having to adjust to handling larger packages, while contracted delivery providers are now encountering more time-definite shipments, EVP and CFO John Dietrich said at a November investor conference.

FedEx has enacted other layoffs this year in the thick of its Network 2.0 rollout, including one tied to the closure of its Conover, North Carolina, ship center. Rival UPS is also closing facilities and shifting more volume to automated hubs as it looks to reduce expenses."
22,2024-12-05 00:00:00,Miniature Reactors Could Supply U.S. Bases With Unlimited Fuel,"The miniature 3D-printed Aqueous Homogenous Reactor reactor overcomes the problems of the metal ... [+] original California Thermodynamics

Supplying fuel to remote military bases has always been an expensive headache; in Afghanistan the Pentagon paid an estimated $400 per gallon to get fuel where it was needed. The logistics chain also created a huge vulnerability, as supply convoys are prime targets for roadside bombs and ambushes. Now startup California Thermodynamics is offering miniature nuclear reactors to produce synthetic fuel on site replacing everything from diesel to Jet A1, removing the need for the entire supply chain and making bases self-sufficient.

Return Of The Water Boiler

The underlying technology dates back to the earliest days of the nuclear age with Aqueous Homogenous Reactors (AHRs) otherwise known as “water boilers” developed in the 1940s. The AHR is a simple design consisting of a solution of uranium salts in water, circulating between an inner reactor chamber and an outer cooling chamber.

Aqueous Homogenous Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Wikimedia commons

The advantage of this setup is that it is very safe. While other reactors rely on control rods which can lead to overheating if removed, the AHR is self-regulating. It is also highly efficient and produces less waste than other types.

The disadvantages include corrosion from the reactive uranium compounds which rapidly eats away metal reactor walls, and low power output compared to reactor other designs. In addition to heat, the AHR produces hydrogen as a by-product; this creates an explosion hazard.

By the 1950s, AHRs were still of some interest to scientific laboratories because of the high neutron flux they produced which could be harnessed to make nuclear isotopes. Overall though they did not have the qualities needed for large-scale power plants, and AHRs were pushed aside by more complex types like the Pressurized Water Reactor which generates most of the world’s nuclear electricity.

The new AHR design negates these problems with a 3D-printed containment vessel made from a novel, patent-pending material not susceptible to corrosion. And the hazardous output of hydrogen gas has been turned into an asset.

“We are taking the historic problem with AHRs, namely excessive hydrogen production, and using it to our advantage. Our design is the most cost effective, and carbon friendly way to make hydrogen on earth,” Stephen Boyd, California Thermodynamics co-founder and CTO, told me.

The new design is a miniature reactor which fits on a standard military pallet and produces 22.4 liters (0.8 gallons) of hydrogen gas per minute. Converting hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbon fuel using the Fischer-Tropsch reaction developed in the 1930s is already a mature technology, the only additional ingredient is carbon dioxide. A base would have an array of reactors, possibly hundred or thousands depending on requirements. These provide far more power per unit area than wind or solar arrays, making them compact and more defensible.

Cross section showing the comparative simplicity of the AHR design California Thermodynamics

Most importantly, rather than making electricity, the new design gives a base a bottomless fuel reserve of liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

“Nuclear powered fuel synthesis represents the next frontier in high performance fuels, produced at the point of demand in even the most remote locations,” says Dan Sutton, CEO of startup Synergetic which produces synthetic fuels commercially. “From forward operating bases to Mars.”

Synergetic’s technology enables the production of synthetic fuels which can be directly substituted for diesel, gasoline, and aviation fuel.

Jennnifer “JJ” Snow, former Chief Technology Officer for the Air Force’s AFWERX which drives innovation, believes the new AHR approach has potential.

“The concept that Cal Thermo has put forward would be a game changer for expeditionary operations,” says Snow. “Providing power and fuel in any austere environment is a persistent challenge. Cal Thermo changes our traditional expeditionary logistics by allowing forces to deploy and move with a solution that can power their footprint and keep them fueled without risking additional assets.”

Nuclear Resurgence?

The idea of military reactors might seen far-fetched. But the military have long been users of nuclear energy, mainly in the form of power plants for submarines and aircraft carriers. And now there is a new willingness to look at nuclear power plants for other applications.

In June, the Pentagon Defense Innovation Unit solicited proposals for small nuclear reactors to power bases in the US by 2030. The idea is to have a series of mini- and micro-reactors which would supply backup power, making bases independent of the power grid. And in September, the DoD started work on Project Pele a transportable nuclear reactor in four 20-foot shipping containers which can be easily moved provide electricity wherever needed. In this environment, small nuclear reactors producing fuel would be a small step.

Producing fuel at remote bases will reduce the need for vulnerable and expensive supply convoys Getty Images

Boyd says California Thermodynamics has already made subscale test versions of their AHR, and plan to produce a full-scale version of the reactor in 2025. This should be licensed to go live with nuclear fuel, and a working production model could be available in three to five years.

The other feature of the AHR is that it produces a high neutron flux which can be used to make medical isotopes and other valuable materials. The company is already in discussion with potential customers for this next phase of development. But at the moment they are focused on the challenge of creating arrays of reactors to make hydrogen on demand to feed synthetic fuel production.

The military, with its reliance on expensive supply chains for remote bases, is an obvious first customer. But ultimately this type of technology might find much wider commercial applications.

“Nuclear reactors for carbon negative chemistry is a fundamental, and quite frankly underinvested technology,” Garrett Kinsman, California Thermodynamics co-founder told me."

Hinkley Point C: Major milestone hit in building UK's newest nuclear power station

Workers have fitted a reactor into the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for 30 years. Hundreds of engineers and construction staff worked for several days to lift the 500-tonne steel equipment into place at Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater, Somerset. ""It was a huge operation for all the teams involved,"" said Matt Abbott, who led the team installing it. ""This is the heart of the plant."" The 13m-long (42.6 ft) unit is one of two reactors which will contain the nuclear chain reaction that will generate enough power for six million homes, when it opens in 2030.

Hinkley Point C The 500-tonne steel nuclear reactor is lowered into position at Hinkley Point

The giant steel cylinder was winched up the side of the reactor building in a 12-hour operation. It then had to be manoevered along rails through a giant equipment hatch, rotated through 90 degrees and lowered carefully onto a prepared base. It will stay there for 60 years of nuclear operation, and decades beyond. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called it ""a major step forward"". He said: “Getting Hinkley up and running to produce clean power for six million homes will be a win for our long-term energy independence.""

Hinkley Point C The 13-metre long cylinder was flipped in mid-air by a purpose-built crane, then lowered into position.

At least 12,000 people work there, alongside more than 100 cranes. The reactor will power 25m high steam generators, and drive turbines featuring the longest blades ever made. Yet the project has been delayed by political debates, the Covid pandemic and supply chain problems. It is now due to open five years later than originally planned. The estimated cost has risen to £46bn from the £18bn predicted in 2017. Nonetheless, installing the reactor is a significant milestone. So how does it work, who made it, and when will they switch it on?

Matt Abbott led hundreds of construction workers who lifted the ""heart of Hinkley"" into place

How does it work?

The reactor is known as ""the heart of Hinkley"". It will contain radioactive uranium split by nuclear fission, in a chain reaction which generates a lot of heat. Temperatures inside will average 300C. Pressure will reach 155 bar, five times more than on a submarine at normal operating depth. The steel vessel is 25cm thick, 13m (42.6 ft) long, and weighs 500 tonnes.

Hinkley Point C The reactor, shrouded in white, was winched up to a hatch on the building which will house it for more than sixty years

A closed loop of pressurised water will pass round the reactor, and heat up. This heat will then be exchanged with a second loop of water, which turns into steam. The steam will drive turbines which generate Hinkley's electricity. Mr Abbott said: ''We’ve got two of these reactors, and each should power about three million homes. So it’s a massive deal and this is now the start of that journey for us.""

Who made it?

The reactor took six years to manufacture and was made in France by a company called Framatome, which is owned by EDF, who are building Hinkley Point C. EDF is owned by the French state. Creating the reactor was a matter of ""immense pride"" for Framatome employees, according to Mathieu Gaulthier, who leads the company's team in Somerset. But why did such a central component of Britain's first new nuclear power plant for a generation have to be made abroad?

“The last nuclear reactor that was built was finished in 1991,"" Ian Henderson, head of Framatome UK. ""In that time that skill base has disappeared."" The firm is now trying to change that. At a brand new factory in Avonmouth, near Bristol, they are training high-level welders and fitters to the exacting standards of the nuclear industry. For Hinkley C, they are fabricating tanks and other structures. But on future nuclear projects, they hope to take on more sophisticated jobs. Mr Henderson explained: ""It's taken quite a few years to build those skills up to where they are today, and we want to keep that going, keep investing.”

When will they switch it on?

In 2007 EDF's French leader Vincent de Rivaz predicted Britons would be cooking their Christmas turkeys on Hinkley power 10 years later. In fact, 2017 was the year M. de Rivaz left EDF. In Somerset, work had only just begun.

As the first concrete was poured, the company said they would switch it on by 2025. But that was followed by global pandemic, a war in Ukraine and disruption to global supply chains. Now, the company expects to begin power generation by ""the end of the decade"". Getting the nuclear reactor into position represents a big milestone passed."
25,2024-12-05 10:39:00,How retailers prepped their supply chains for 2024’s holiday crunch,"Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

The holiday season is the most important time of year for retailers. But what happens when the critical stretch between Black Friday and Christmas is five days shorter than usual?

In 2024, the time crunch is expected to push more shoppers to open their wallets earlier, especially online. During Black Friday alone, online sales rose more than 10% compared with 2023, while Cyber Monday spending jumped more than 7%, per Adobe Analytics.

But with Black Friday sales now in the rearview mirror, retailers have less time than usual to capitalize on the busy shopping season, causing potential challenges.

Lowe’s EVP and CFO Brandon Sink said the trimmed timeframe could create volatility that impacts holiday demand. Meanwhile, Target expects the shortened period to amount to a nearly one percentage point headwind to its Q4 2024 comparisons, according to CFO Jim Lee.

Others, however, are less concerned by the calendar, given how early consumers now start their holiday shopping.

“We've seen over the last handful of years, that holiday shopping season really extending, and that that kind of Black Friday to Christmas timeframe isn't quite the kind of landmark that it maybe historically was in the past,” said Jess Dankert, VP of supply chain for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.

Regardless of how worried retailers are about the shorter shopping period, the key to navigating the volatility is planning early.

J.C. Penney, for example, began its product and supply chain planning more than a year ago and adjusted its strategy based on trends as the year progressed, SVP of Supply Chain Chad Duennes said in an email.

Gearing up for peak season

Beyond a shortened stretch between Black Friday and Christmas, retailers have had to navigate other pre-peak season disruptions, including the three-day strike at East and Gulf Coast ports in October. Despite the turbulence, holiday sales are expected to increase as much as 3.5% year over year in 2024, according to multiple forecasts.

For many retailers, the work stoppage proved to be another exercise in supply chain planning.

“We knew for a fact that retailers were, in some cases, all developing contingency plans in the event of a potential strike at that Oct. 1/Sept. 30 expiration deadline,” Dankert said.

Contingency plans varied from company to company. Some opted to pull cargo ahead of the deadline while others diverted shipments to West Coast ports.

Retailers that decided to bring in goods ahead of the strike may have been forced to start selling holiday inventory earlier than usual, effectively lengthening the season, according to Dankert. But an earlier onset of the holiday shopping season can be a strategic benefit by alleviating fulfillment and product replenishment pressure while building on other high-volume periods.

“We had a good back-to-school [year]. We had a good Halloween, and it's important to string these holidays together so we go into the season with momentum,” said Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner on a Nov. 19 earnings call. “We're excited about that and we think we have a great plan for the season.”

The retail giant has been particularly focused on automating its supply chain and expanding its delivery reach ahead of the holiday season. The efforts have helped it consistently cut delivery costs this year.

“We've seen over the last handful of years, that holiday shopping season really extending, and that that kind of Black Friday to Christmas timeframe isn't quite the kind of landmark that it maybe historically was in the past."" Jess Dankert VP of supply chain for the Retail Industry Leaders Association

Walmart was not alone in experiencing improved sales performance as the holidays approached. Retail sales grew 2.8% year over year on an unadjusted basis in October, per the U.S. Census Bureau.

“October’s pickup in retail sales shows a healthy pace of spending as many consumers got an early start on holiday shopping,” National Retail Federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a Nov. 15 press release. “October sales were a good early step forward into the holiday shopping season, which is now fully underway.”

Coordinating for the holidays

As the holiday shopping season has extended over the years, the ways retailers coordinate their strategies have also shifted, according to Dankert.

“There's really no room for silos within the retailers anymore,” Dankert said. “There's so much more of a collaborative planning approach, particularly as something as high stakes as the holiday shopping season.”

Such collaboration means companies are lining up their sales and marketing pushes with inventory and fulfillment timelines.

For example, retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s began their holiday marketing campaigns early, while others launched their Black Friday sales in early November.

“While we anticipate earlier shopping this year, there will still be plenty of last-minute shopping, so our investments in modernizing our supply chain will help us offer more efficient and cost-effective ways to fulfill orders and reduce delivery times this holiday season."" Chad Duennes SVP of supply chain at J.C. Penney

Similarly, J.C. Penney began rolling out its “Really Big Deals Reveals” marketing strategy in September with advertisements on Amazon Prime Video’s Thursday Night Football broadcasts.

The retailer, which made AI a major pillar of its $1 billion supply chain investment, has developed flexible staffing and AI-enabled shipment models for the holidays as well, Duennes said. The moves have allowed the company to extend customer shipping cutoffs for orders around key holidays and events.

“While we anticipate earlier shopping this year, there will still be plenty of last-minute shopping, so our investments in modernizing our supply chain will help us offer more efficient and cost-effective ways to fulfill orders and reduce delivery times this holiday season,” Duennes said.

J.C. Penney is one of several retailers leveraging new technology as part of its holiday preparation tactics. Companies are also leaning into AI-enabled demanding planning and forecasting to set more effective plans, according to Dankert.

“It's much more integrated and much more collaborative and much more enabled by technology,” Dankert said."

The amount of Guinness pubs can buy in the build up to Christmas has been limited by its maker Diageo after ""exceptional demand"" over the past three weeks. It is understood the firm is working at 100% production capacity, but has still placed limits on orders in Great Britain. The drink has been rising in popularity with women and young people, and recent rugby internationals have put a strain on supplies. Diageo has been upping its marketing efforts and working with influencers over the past few years to try and raise Guinness' profile.

The BBC understands that Diageo is allocating supplies on a weekly basis to make sure it has enough stock to meet demand over Christmas.

A Diageo spokesperson said: “Over the past month we have seen exceptional consumer demand for Guinness in Great Britain. ""We have maximised supply and we are working proactively with our customers to manage the distribution to trade as efficiently as possible.""

Guinness sales have recently been bucking market trends, according to data from food and drinks industry research firm CGA. While overall beer drinking was slightly down between July and October, the volume of Guinness consumed from kegs was up more than fifth. Diageo has been pumping money into its St James's Gate brewery in Dublin, and also building a new brewery in County Kildare.

It has been focusing marketing efforts on trying to expand the appeal of Guinness, with tie-ups with Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi and actor Jason Momoa.

27,2024-12-04 09:33:00,Best Buy expects tariffs to drive price increases,"Listen to the article 2 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

Best Buy expects prices to increase for U.S. consumers if tariff hikes are implemented under President-elect Donald Trump, according to a Q3 earnings call .

The electronics retailer will bring some products in ahead of any potential tariffs, and it is also planning out its vendor and SKU assortments and promotional and pricing strategies, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told analysts.

“Typically, in history, this ends up being some kind of costs that are shared,” Barry said. “To some extent, the vendors have some, to some extent Best Buy but, of course, we see that the customer ends up bearing some of the cost of tariffs, and we've seen this before.”

Dive Insight:

Best Buy and other similar retailers may be particularly vulnerable to Trump’s proposed tariffs since “there's very little in the consumer electronics space that is not imported,” Barry said.

The company is the importer of record on only 2% to 3% of its products, according to the CEO, who noted most of the production of goods it controls has been moved out of China. Best Buy reported 60% of its costs of goods sold came from China in Q3.

New tariffs could also impact Best Buy’s sourcing from Mexico, a country which accounts for its second-highest total of imports after China.

Last week, Trump said he plans to levy a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada on his first day in office. He also imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China.

The complexity of Best Buy’s supply chain creates additional hurdles for the retailer, according to Barry, as its reliance on fewer direct imports means it has direct control of very few of its supply chains.

“I think at the end of the day, everybody in the industry believes diversification is a very good thing, but it is not easy,” Barry said.

Many other retailers are bracing for Trump’s proposed tariff hikes. For example, Williams-Sonoma said it is prepared to reduce exports to China, while TJX said tariffs would create a surplus of inventory for the retailer to acquire goods at advantageous prices."

Dive Brief:

L'Oréal Groupe and credit specialist Chenavari Investment Managers launched a debt fund last month to help small- and medium-sized enterprises address scope 3 commitments, according to a Nov. 18 press release.

The Solstice fund aims to enable easier supplier access to funding to make progress on decarbonization industrial projects and initiatives, according to the press release. Outside institutional investors can also contribute to the fund.

L'Oréal has committed an initial €50 million ($53 million) to the Solstice decarbonization fund. Qualifying projects can include industrial process and supply chain, clean energy and clean transportation.

Dive Insight:

The Solstice fund builds on L'Oréal’s existing sustainability efforts. In 2020, the group launched L'Oréal for the Future with the intention of driving decarbonization throughout its value chain, including raw material sourcing, manufacturing and packaging. The program also engages with L'Oréal’s suppliers to address emission targets.

The company also has set up a Green Sciences transition program that targets the sustainable sourcing of raw materials, according to the press release.

Scope 3 emissions represent a majority of L'Oréal’s carbon footprint, according to its most recent climate transition plan. The company aims to reduce its scope 3 emissions by 28% by 2030, compared to a 2019 baseline.

A majority of the company’s scope 3 impact is related to supplier activities, according to L'Oréal’s climate plan.

L'Oréal intends to train and support its suppliers’ understanding of climate change, and directly work with them to reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The cosmetic company will also help its suppliers identify the main drivers of industry decarbonization and set expectations. Increasing supplier transparency and tracking for product emissions is also a main goal.

Securing funding for decarbonization initiatives and projects can be a hurdle for many suppliers, and collaborative financing tools can often help bridge that gap. In 2023, retail giant H&M launched the Future Supplier Initiative in partnership with Singapore-based bank DBS to enable suppliers to access infrastructure investment loans."
29,NaN,DFDS promises new vessels for Jersey ferry service,"DFDS promises new vessels and improvements

DFDS Filip Werne Hermann said DFDS would run two high-speed ferries, a freight vessel and a ropax vessel for Jersey

The ferry provider chosen to operate services to Jersey has promised three new vessels in the next six years. Filip Werne Hermann, Head of Channel and Baltics at DFDS, said he expected to see immediate improvements to the service. On Tuesday the Government of Jersey announced it had chosen DFDS to run the passenger and freight services rather than Brittany Ferries, which Guernsey has chosen. Mr Hermann said the two ferry firms would ""have to work together and we'll happily do so, not least about the inter-island sailings"".

DFDS has promised three new vessels will be brought in during the next six years

He said: ""We had of course hoped for a joint service but now we focus on Jersey and we believe it's certainly viable."" Mr Hermann said DFDS planned to invest in three new vessels over six years which would replace those in use, one at a time. ""During the first period, the fleet will be two high-speed craft, one for the north and one for the south, and then a dedicated freight vessel and a ropax vessel,"" he explained. ""It will be a quite similar, if not better, fleet,"" he added.

'Better design supply chains'

Mr Hermann said a detailed finance plan had formed part of the tender documents and that DFDS had a ""strong financial profile"". He said no money would be given to the firm by Jersey's government. He also refuted concerns that prices of goods may rise, saying ""we might even be able to better design the supply chains to Jersey now that we can focus on one island and that's one of the first things we'll do"". Mr Hermann said it was too soon to detail sailings but promised an ""attractive schedule"" due to its frequent, high-speed vessels. He said his team was ""working day and night"" to get the booking portal ready for travellers to book crossings.

31,NaN,Airbus to axe nearly 500 UK jobs to cut costs,"Airbus cuts nearly 500 UK jobs to reduce costs

The cuts come as the firm's profits fall even as its sales rise, with the plane maker admitting in July it was struggling with ""bottlenecks"" in its supply chain .

Compulsory job cuts are not planned, the firm said, adding ""almost all of the positions affected"" do not relate to specific projects or programmes.

More than 2,000 jobs - 5% of its workforce - will be lost globally by mid 2026.

Airbus will axe 477 jobs in the UK as the plane maker scales back its space business and tries to trim costs.

It told the BBC at the time it has ""more demand than the ability to supply"" and admitted it was falling behind on orders.

The company said on Wednesday evening it wanted to reduce its ""fixed cost base"" and that it will ""will work with its social partners to limit the impact by utilising all available social measures"".

The space arm of its business will take the brunt of cuts, with 1,128 jobs to go from that department.

A further 618 jobs will be cut from its headquarters, 250 from its air power department, and 47 from its connected intelligence department.

The job cuts will also be spread out geographically, with the bulk occurring in Western Europe:

Germany - 689

France - 540

United Kingdom - 477

Spain - 303

Rest of world - 34

The job cuts come as Airbus' profit fell 22% to £1.8bn even as sales rose 7% to £44.5bn in its most recent results, which cover the nine months to 30th October.

Its thin profit margins mean relatively small rises in costs can hurt profits.

This is not the first time in the last few years Airbus has had to cut back on staff.

In 2020, it announced 15,000 job cuts globally and 1,700 in the UK specifically as the pandemic grounded flights, hitting plane makers' and airlines' profits.

The Unite union criticised the decision at the time as ""another act of industrial vandalism"" against the UK aerospace sector."

Reuters

Supermarkets in the UK that appear to be selling products linked to slave labour in China may be “complicit in putting profits above human rights”, a Labour MP has said. Sarah Champion’s comments come after a BBC Eye Investigation found that tomato puree sold in four leading UK supermarkets - Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose - appeared to contain tomatoes produced using harsh and coercive forced labour in Xinjiang. Some of the products have “Italian” in their name others have “Italian” in their description. All the supermarkets whose products were tested previously disputed the BBC's findings, while China also denies it uses forced labour in its westernmost province.

In an urgent question in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Champion described the UK’s product labelling as “weak and confusing"" The chairwoman of the International Development Select Committee also called for consumers to be given more information on which countries the product ingredients come from and stronger legislation to effectively ban the importing of products made with forced labour. Champion said UK supply chains are ""awash with Uighur forced labour products"" because human rights due diligence is ""optional"" for British companies. ""To supermarkets, I say, all of you are complicit in putting profits above human rights and I hope the British public do the right thing and make their mark with their pocket, in their wallet,"" she said. BBC Eye's Blood on the Shelves investigation found that a total of 17 products - most of them own-brands sold in UK and German retailers - are likely to contain Chinese tomatoes - testing commissioned by the BBC World Service shows. Most Chinese tomatoes come from the Xinjiang region, where their production is linked to forced labour by Uyghur and other largely Muslim minorities. The UN accuses the Chinese state - which views these minorities as a security risk - of torture and abuse. China denies it forces people to work in the tomato industry and says workers’ rights are protected by law. It says the UN report is based on “disinformation and lies”."

Dive Brief:

Since mid-2022, Amazon has allegedly violated a Washington, D.C., consumer protection law by withholding benefits from Prime members in two zip codes, according to a civil lawsuit, citing “undisclosed internal policies,” that was filed Wednesday by the district’s attorney general.

Noting that Prime members pay $139 per year or $14.99 per month, the lawsuit states that Amazon “deliberately — and secretly — stopped providing its fastest delivery service to the nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in historically underserved communities east of the Anacostia River,” per court filings.

In an emailed statement to Retail Dive, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel called the claims “categorically false,” adding that the company “made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.”

Dive Insight:

Wednesday’s lawsuit alleges that Amazon systematically reduced its services to the two zip codes, in violation of the city’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act.

That law “prohibits a broad range of deceptive and unfair business practices, including misleading consumers, making misrepresentations, and failing to disclose important information about products or services.”

Before Amazon’s alleged change in policy, for example, more than 72% of Prime deliveries to those areas occurred within two days of checkout, while afterward just a quarter were, according to a Wednesday press release from the AG’s office. Meanwhile, delivery speeds in other areas of the city got faster, with nearly three-quarters of Prime members in those places enjoying two-day delivery.

Amazon violated the consumer-protection statute by leading residents in these zip codes to believe that would be privy to Prime’s two-day shipping, misleading existing members and inducing others there to sign up for Prime, according to the attorney general’s press release. Moreover, the e-retailer responded to customer complaints about this by saying that slower times were rare and weren’t purposeful.

The e-commerce giant in its marketing materials caveats that free same-day delivery is only available in select areas, but doesn’t say the same about one- and two-day shipping, except to point out that free two-day delivery “is available for ‘[n]early all addresses in contiguous U.S.,’” per the court filing.

Amazon said in a follow-up email that it is ""constantly reviewing data and conditions relating to safety, the weather, volume, speed, and more all in the best interest of our customers, employees, and those who deliver on our behalf, and making changes accordingly as these variables change.""

The company also said it is transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process on when they can expect orders to arrive. “What we’d like to do, and have offered, is to work together with the Attorney General and their office in an effort to reduce crime and improve safety in these areas,” the spokesperson said.

Regarding Wednesday's lawsuit, the company emphasized safety issues.

“We want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every zip code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,” Nantel said. “In the zip codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages.”

Safety measures that can slow down delivery speeds include reserving deliveries for daytime hours or having third-party services take over the job, the company said by phone.

In fact, the complaint points to the second solution, alleging that to serve these affected areas, Amazon partners “exclusively with third-party delivery services like UPS and the US Postal Service, which it knows are often slower than Amazon’s.”

“Amazon knew its ‘exclusion’ would result in significantly slower deliveries for residents living in these two ZIP codes yet it never informed existing or prospective Prime members living there of that exclusion,” per the AG’s release.

While the lawsuit claims that Amazon fails to disclose limitations on same-day shipping until after someone from the affected zip codes signs up for Prime, Amazon said that customers are provided with estimated delivery times after they place an order.

Nearly half the population in the two affected zip codes are Prime members, per the AG’s release, and those areas represent “two-thirds of the District east of the Anacostia River, historically the most underserved part of the District,” per the court filing.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another. We’re suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they’re paying for.”"
35,2024-12-04 11:20:00,Trump taps Peter Navarro as lead trade adviser,"Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Donald Trump named former White House official Peter Navarro as his ""Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing,"" the president-elect announced on Truth Social Wednesday.

Navarro, who served as an assistant to the president and director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy in the first Trump administration, will play a decisive role in shaping the U.S.’s upcoming trade agenda.

""The Senior Counselor position leverages Peter’s broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills,"" Trump wrote in his announcement. ""His mission will be to help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas.""

It is unclear if Navarro's post will be a cabinet-level position, or how it will interact with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative or Department of Commerce, both of which Trump has also said will lead his trade and tariff policy.

Trump has named international trade lawyer Jamieson Greer as his nominee for USTR, and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department.

Navarro was part of trade talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement during Trump's first term. The U.S.-Korea trade deal, renegotiated in March 2018, exempted South Korea from steel tariffs imposed earlier that month in exchange for the country limiting imports of the commodity into the U.S.

""This will be as effective as the tariff and preserve the integrity of the steel industry,"" Navarro said in a National Public Radio interview at the time. ""So let's not talk about exemptions, letting anybody out. Everybody understands as they negotiate with the United States that if they're let out of the tariffs, they will have a quota or some other similar restriction.""

Trump continues to make heightened tariffs and an aggressive trade policy central tenets of his upcoming agenda. On Monday, the president-elect threatened 100% tariffs on BRICS countries, including Russia and China, if the informal contingent shifts away from the U.S. dollar.

The threat followed recent promises of a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, the U.S.'s largest trade partners, and an additional 10% tariff hike on imports from China.

Navarro will take on the role after a recent stint in prison. In March, the Trump loyalist began serving a four-month prison sentence for a contempt of Congress conviction. He was released in July.

The conviction stemmed from Navarro's failure to comply with a subpoena from the United States House Select Committee regarding its investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Navarro was the first Trump official to serve a prison sentence for a crime related to the attack."
36,2024-12-04 00:00:00,Unlocking Supply Chain Efficiency: How Technology And Finance Innovators Are Redefining Inventory Management,"In today's manufacturing and supply chain environment, a staggering amount of capital is tied up in inventory and procurement, with trillions of dollars being resourced for indirect and direct materials. In fact, across the globe, this significant oversupply is unwittingly locked within the supply chain to manage supply risk, restricting flexibility and hindering effective use of working capital.

What if businesses could not only right-size their inventory levels in warehouses but also optimize them on their balance sheets? This ideal scenario requires a deep understanding of current inventory, accurate forecasting of future needs based on market trends, and a strategic approach to financing procurement or disposing excess stock with maximum financial flexibility.

A new wave of innovators in purpose-built AI technology and finance is making this vision a reality. By combining intelligent inventory optimization with innovative procurement financing, the path is emerging to revolutionize supply chain efficiency without compromise.

Can a combination of technology and refined financial strategies transform the way global enterprises plan for the efficient use of redeploying this capital? In a recent conversation with Sean Hanafin, CEO of Silver Birch Finance, we discussed how, today, working capital finance plays a significant part in supply chain and procurement efficiency, especially as companies get larger and are more distributed. In particular, we discussed how the shift in supply chain technology is ever-changing and how new methods to solve old problems have evolved. In particular, combining today’s AI advancements and financing solutions can enable companies to liberate capital, creating leaner and more resilient supply chains, especially in asset-intensive large industrial settings. Here are the key takeaways and strategies from our conversation.

Harnessing AI and Human Expertise for Inventory Precision

One of the most pressing issues supply chain professionals face is the lack of accurate, real-time visibility into inventory levels. Traditional systems often rely on outdated technology and fragmented data sources, leading to redundant ordering, inflated storage costs, and inevitable write-offs due to obsolescence. These inefficiencies tie up capital and hinder a company's ability to respond swiftly to market changes.

One way to address this challenge is to leverage the power of AI and combine it with the deep institutional knowledge of company personnel. Instead of only automating data processing, this approach augments the expertise of employees who understand the nuances of their operations. This synergy between AI and human insight allows businesses to optimize inventory levels more effectively, reduce costs, and retain critical knowledge that might otherwise be lost due to staff turnover or retirement.

By ensuring that the right assets are in the right place at the right time, companies enhance operational efficiency and contribute positively to the broader economy. Efficient inventory management reduces waste and minimizes environmental impact, aligning with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives and promoting sustainable practices across the supply chain.

Resolving the Treasury and Procurement Tug-of-War

However, optimal inventory levels are only half the battle. This is because organizations consistently grapple with an internal tug-of-war between treasury and procurement departments. Treasury aims to keep inventory as lean as possible to maintain a strong balance sheet, emphasizing that tied-up capital incurs costs without equivalent returns. Conversely, procurement gets pushed by internal supply chain stakeholders who advocate for robust stock levels to ensure operational continuity and mitigate supply risks.

According to Sean, innovative financial solutions are emerging to bridge this gap, allowing companies to acquire necessary inventory without the initial capital outlay. This approach satisfies procurement's need for adequate stock while aligning with the treasury's financial constraints.

Sean explains, ""By removing the capital barrier, companies will operate more efficiently and responsively. Procurement teams can secure the necessary inventory, and treasury departments can preserve financial flexibility.""

Additionally, there are options to monetize obsolete or slow-moving assets without compromising price or timing. Companies savor the opportunity to free up the funds they have tied up in excess inventory and then reinvest them into higher-return activities. On the whole, this impacts the bottom line substantially.

A Unified Approach for Greater Impact

Large industrial manufacturing, oil and gas companies, among other industries, are increasingly responding positively to a unified AI technology and supply chain finance approach. One major manufacturing company faced excess inventory and high holding costs due to its limited visibility throughout multiple facilities. They transformed their procurement process by adopting advanced technology for accurate inventory insights and leveraging innovative financing.

Suppliers were paid promptly under existing terms without the need for complex supply chain finance programs or additional contracts. This strengthened supplier relationships and enhanced supplier stability, making the client a preferred partner. The company also monetized obsolete inventory, freeing up warehouse space and capital for reinvestment. By synchronizing asset acquisition with actual usage needs, they reduced unnecessary expenditures and optimized cash flow without compromising operational effectiveness.

Driving ESG Goals and Economic Empowerment

The collaboration between technology and finance innovators doesn't just benefit individual companies; it has broader implications for ESG goals and economic empowerment. Efficient inventory management and optimized procurement contribute to sustainability by reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact. Financial solutions that support suppliers of all sizes promote economic inclusivity and strengthen the overall supply chain ecosystem.

Conclusion

In an era where supply chain complexities are heightened by global uncertainties in the face of potential tariffs and a trade war, the fusion of advanced technology and innovative finance offers a pathway to unprecedented efficiency and resilience. By right-sizing inventory in warehouses and on balance sheets, companies can unlock significant value, reduce risks, and position themselves for sustainable growth.

The collaborative efforts of AI technology and strategic finance have emerged to reflect how combining strengths leads to more significant synergies and client value. As more businesses adopt these integrated solutions, the benefits will extend beyond individual organizations, contributing to a more agile, sustainable, and inclusive global supply chain.

The future of resilient supply chain management lies in partnerships, where legacy technologies, intelligent purpose-built plug-ins, and finance work hand in hand to solve age-old challenges. It's a promising development that addresses immediate operational needs and supports broader economic empowerment and ESG objectives—a win-win for all stakeholders involved."

Burlington is leaning on supply chain upgrades to drive cost reductions as it grows its store footprint.

The company expects its capital expenditures to be around 7% of sales this year and in 2025, Wolfe told analysts. This “slightly higher” than historical spending level will be led by new store openings and distribution center investments.

On the distribution center front, the discount retailer is focusing on owning rather than leasing, Wolfe added.

“This will enable us to design these facilities to support the flexibility and efficiency that our off-price model requires,” Wolfe said.

Burlington announced in March that it will open a 2 million-square-foot distribution center in Savannah, Georgia, in 2026. Wolfe told analysts last week the company plans to own the facility and that it may “explore opportunities” to take ownership of other facilities it is currently leasing.

Burlington owned just two of its 12 primary distribution centers and warehousing facilities as of February, per an SEC filing.

Beyond having more direct ownership of its distribution centers, Burlington aims to continue investing in automation within its facilities to improve productivity.

“We're redesigning how merchandise flows within the DC, automating select processes, ultimately reducing touches and time to process merchandise and saving labor dollars in DCs,” Wolfe said.

Following the opening of the Savannah facility, the company plans to further modernize its supply chain with larger and more automated distribution centers after 2028, according to Wolfe.

With new distribution centers, Burlington has an opportunity to design the facilities with more automation to service its off-price retail model, Wolfe said."

Walmart is closing its Sam’s Club fulfillment center in Swedesboro, New Jersey, effective March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice.

The company is relocating its fulfillment operations at the Swedesboro Sam’s Club center to other facilities within Walmart’s network, a spokesperson told Supply Chain Dive in an email.

Approximately 113 employees will be affected, per the WARN notice. Walmart will provide employees with a paid job search period from Nov. 21 to March 7, when they can apply for open positions at nearby Walmart stores, Sam’s Clubs or other company facilities, the WARN notice said.

“We’re continuously evolving our fulfillment network to improve service for our customers and members as their needs change,” the spokesperson said. “Over time, as our fulfillment network has grown and we have launched new buildings, we’ve been able to serve customers and members with better reliability and speed by shifting volume to these other facilities.”

Associates will also have an opportunity to transfer to one of its nearby facilities including its new next generation fulfillment center in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, or any other next generation fulfillment centers across the country, the spokesperson said.

Other nearby facilities that are nearby include a distribution center in Smyrna, Delaware, a fulfillment center in Westampton, New Jersey, and another in Pedricktown.

Employees who decide to transfer to Walmart’s next generation facilities are eligible to receive a $7,500 transfer bonus and will receive training to work with fulfillment technology.

The next-generation fulfillment centers lean on warehouse technology that condenses the retailer’s 12-step fulfillment process down to five steps. These facilities also provide next- or two-day shipping and are part of the company’s goal to automate its supply chain.

“We continue to make progress in the automation of our supply chain, as now more than 50% of our fulfillment center volume is automated, which is twice as much at this point last year,” Walmart EVP and CFO John David Rainey said in a Q3 earnings call on Nov. 19."

Dive Brief:

UPS Supply Chain Solutions has teamed up with robotics company Verity to track inventory via autonomous drones, according to a November announcement.

The partnership launched at the UPS Velocity facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, in July as ""the first of many potential sites,"" per Verity's website. The distribution location has a 266,000-square-foot storage area and manages over 930,000 inventory movements annually.

The number of hours spent on inventory processes is already down by half at the UPS site, according to Verity, while “high-reach tasks"" have been eliminated for employees.

Dive Insight:

Verity's drones are helping UPS solve the frequent pain point of inventory accuracy, Mary Ann Crawford, an industrial engineering manager at UPS Supply Chain Solutions, said in a video about the collaboration. Inaccurate counts and misplaced items can cascade into order fulfillment disruptions if not handled properly.

""When your inventory is off, you're going to feel it in every different area of the operation,"" Crawford said. ""You'll feel it when you go to put a case away and you can't fit it in the location because the location is full, or you go to pick or replenish a case and the case that you wanted is not there.""

To address that challenge, Verity said its drones provide inventory checks daily and full-facility audits twice per month. This helps UPS Supply Chain Solutions identify stock discrepancies while maintaining accurate data on inventory levels.

Verity's drones are particularly useful for the UPS Velocity facility, according to Verity. The location features a ""very narrow aisle configuration"" that optimizes space but presents hurdles for larger equipment like forklifts.

UPS isn't the only company tapping into Verity's services. Last year, Maersk announced it was deploying Verity drones at its warehouses for stronger inventory tracking. Sportswear brand On recently revealed its own collaboration with Verity to increase visibility in its fulfillment operations."
40,2024-11-26 00:00:00,Board.org Launches the Supply Chain Planning & Logistics Board,"TORONTO, Canada —

Board.org, in tandem with Executive Platforms, has launched the Supply Chain Planning & Logistics Board, a membership organization exclusively for senior supply chain leaders at the world's largest companies.

Supply chains are increasingly complex, leaving leaders to navigate a constant stream of challenging decisions. This community was created to provide real solutions from those who know the issues best—enterprise supply chain peers.

""Having worked as a senior supply chain leader for over 40 years for three of the top global 100 companies (P&G, Kraft Foods, and Mondelēz International), I see a major need for a forum where leaders in similar supply chain roles meet and learn from each other,"" said Daniel Myers, former Executive VP of Global Supply Chain for Mondelēz International and current Senior Fellow at the University of Tennessee. ""The planning and logistics leaders in all companies face a major need to develop a total new level of capability to meet their current and future business challenges.""

Memberships offer planning and logistics executives a confidential, vendor-free space for peer-to-peer conversations. Members connect through timely calls on urgent issues, one-on-one connections with fellow leaders who have tackled similar challenges, and annual events for deeper, more in-depth discussions.

“I see firsthand how having these conversations in a confidential space enables our members to build meaningful connections, exchange solutions, and avoid costly missteps to drive success across their organizations,” said Cheryl Goldsby, Membership Director of the Supply Chain Planning & Logistics Board.

The Supply Chain Planning & Logistics Board is the fastest-growing supply chain group, already bringing together over 100 supply chain leaders from 40+ leading brands, including founding members 3M, Cummins, Ecolab, General Mills, Greif, HP, Inc., Ingredion, INX International, Kellanova, Kenvue, Kohler Kitchen & Bath, Levi Strauss & Company, Loblaw, Mars, Milo's Tea Company, Nissan North America, Peloton Interactive, Procter & Gamble, Shamrock Foods, SpartanNash, Stanley 1913, The Hershey Company, The Walt Disney Company, Tree Top, Viega LLC, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Werfen.

""Sharing perspective with the world's supply chain leaders; the intrinsic value is beyond words,"" said Anthony De Francesco, Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain at INX International. ""I truly enjoy participating with our field's best and brightest professionals—it is a real game changer.""

The group will tackle ongoing challenges and emerging trends in logistics and planning, such as risk management, geopolitical instability, market volatility/macroeconomic issues, and more.

The Supply Chain Planning & Logistics Board is strictly limited to senior-level leaders and excludes vendors and consultants to ensure all discussions remain focused, strategic, and actionable."
41,2024-12-03 00:00:00,Navigating The FDA’s Food Traceability Mandate: What Restaurants Need To Know,"Craig Dunaway is the Chief Operating Officer of Penn Station East Coast Subs.

getty

If you watched the news this past summer, you likely saw recalls of deli meats and poultry products. Multiple companies have recalled millions of pounds of food in recent months due to a connection with a nationwide listeria outbreak.

The government is keeping a close eye on what is happening. Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows increased detection of certain foodborne pathogens. That data, combined with the summer’s major recalls, are incredibly unfortunate examples of why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is focused on an ""overhaul"" of the food supply system.

Starting in January 2026, companies part of producing, processing, packing and holding food items will be required to keep thorough records of food traceability (though there are some exemptions). Aimed at enhancing food safety and accelerating response times to foodborne illness epidemics, this new ruling is part of the Food Safety Modernization Act and is often known as FSMA 204 or Rule 204. These companies must keep track of ""key data elements"" and ""critical tracking events"" for all foods on the Food Traceability List. They’re also required to share this information with their supply chain partners, ensuring all parties are aware of when the food was last handled.

While Rule 204 of the FSMA sounds ideal for consumers, it means companies need to make some necessary upgrades. Restaurants, even as part of the broader supply chain, need to be prepared for these upcoming changes. While 2026 might sound far off, if you haven’t educated your team or started the process of updating your systems, you need to respond sooner rather than later.

Why These New Standards Are Necessary

In addition to the recent listeria outbreak, more than 400 cases of salmonella were linked to cucumbers grown in Florida, and nearly 300 coffee products were recalled over concerns of botulism contamination. At the time of this writing, there have been more than 250 recalls, market withdrawals and safety alerts in 2024 alone, according to FDA data.

Situations like these can lead the public to lose faith in the food supply chain. The rule is designed to ensure improved traceability that will force suppliers to be held accountable, reduce the number and impact of future outbreaks and protect the health of consumers.

And while restaurants (and grocery stores) are usually the final stop in the supply chain before products reach the consumer, we still need to be diligent in our efforts to protect the health of customers with respect to the food supply. When people come to us, they expect to get a fresh, delicious and safe meal. With these high-profile outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, consumers often expect stricter safety standards—and brands must be ready to meet their demands.

Steps Restaurants Can Take To Prepare For Compliance

To ensure compliance with Rule 204, retail food businesses, including restaurants, must meet certain record-keeping requirements for all products they sell on the Food Traceability List. To do that successfully, you can incorporate the following:

Analyze established systems.

First, conduct an internal audit to fully understand how you currently identify FTL products. Look for areas of improvement or processes that don’t meet the requirements of Rule 204. This information will guide you in developing a traceability plan to bring your operations and recordkeeping up to code.

Embrace technology.

An efficient way of tracking food supply is by using radio frequency identification labels. Also known as smart labels, they allow you to document and trace individual products and maintain inventory. These labels are custom markers with online access, permitting information to be shared when requested, which can help ensure compliance.

Provide employee training.

Stress the importance of the FSMA to your employees. Help them understand their role and responsibilities in ensuring compliance, and make sure they’re trained on the new systems you’ve put in place. Consider periodically hosting routine refresher training sessions to ensure the entire team stays aligned.

Collaborate with suppliers and distributors.

Beyond your staff, work closely with your distributor partners, vendors and other suppliers to help ensure every product is properly tracked from production to point-of-sale by these partners. Data sharing and accurate recordkeeping help everyone stay accountable and aligned, which can reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses and enable fast responses to any concerns.

Stay focused.

Unfortunately, this is not a “set it and forget it” situation. You should continue to review your systems and conduct internal audits to assess the efficiency of your traceability plan. Keep in mind that as things progress, the FDA may follow up with additional updates or requirements. You’ll need to make sure your protocols align with FDA requests.

Why Start Now

Delaying something to the last minute rarely works out. Sure, some people respond well to the pressure of a looming deadline. As the saying goes, “No pressure, no diamonds.” But in this instance, being ahead of the curve is to your advantage.

Getting systems updated now gives you the opportunity to iron out any wrinkles before January 2026. Also, it’s no secret that these necessary upgrades are going to cost money. Starting now allows you to better budget the overall investment.

Until the past few years, the food industry hasn’t always been an early adopter of new technologies. Compared to retail or manufacturing businesses, we’ve relied on more traditional methods to manage our operations. However, in recent years, we’ve made incredible strides and are catching up with our industry counterparts.

All this change may seem like a lot, but in reality, it’s the nature of doing business in today’s regulatory climate environment. Learning to pivot your strategy, systems and policies can help protect your restaurant, even during uncertain times. And in this case, embracing change could help protect your customers as well.

Blue Yonder is making progress toward a full recovery following a pre-Thanksgiving ransomware attack, the company said Sunday. A number of impacted customers are back up and running.

The Arizona-based supply chain technology company was the target of a Nov. 21 ransomware attack, which impacted its managed services hosted environment. Major companies, including Starbucks and U.K. supermarket chain Morrisons, dealt with operational disruptions in connection with the attack.

“We are making good progress, several of our impacted customers have been brought back online, and we are actively working directly with others to return them to normal business operations,” a Blue Yonder spokesperson said via email.

Morrisons, which has about 500 stores in the U.K., said the Blue Yonder attack led to an outage in its warehouse management systems for fresh food and produce. The company on Monday said the situation has significantly improved.

“We are recovering quickly and our back up system is working well,” a spokesperson said via email.

There are still some supermarkets where some products are not fully available, but the chain said it is making good progress, Morrisons said.

Starbucks last week said the attack impacted an internal platform the company uses to track hours worked by employees. The company reverted to manual processes to make sure workers would get paid. A spokesperson was not immediately available for comment Monday.

Other large customers of Blue Yonder remained unaffected. DHL, which also uses Blue Yonder technology, said it was not directly impacted by the attack. “We are aware of isolated infrastructure outages in Blue Yonder’s systems that are reportedly impacting some of their customers,” a DHL spokesperson said via email.

Blue Yonder has not commented on any details of the attack, except to say there was no impact on its Azure public cloud environment.

Supply chain security has been a major concern for retailers, particularly this close to Thanksgiving and Black Friday, which kicks off the Christmas holiday shopping season.

Sophos data shows 45% of retail organizations were hit by ransomware in 2024, largely because of exploited vulnerabilities.

""Supply chain attacks pose a growing threat to organizations, applying significant pressure on the customers who rely on these vendors,” Peter Mackenzie, director, incident response at Sophos, said via email. “While the full impact of this particular attack remains unclear, affected customers often have limited options while awaiting remediation.

The National Retail Federation, working with The Chertoff Group, released a supply chain risk management guide in mid-November to help retailers better protect their inventory ahead of the holiday season.

“Third-party risk is something that every organization is working to navigate, especially across an increasingly complex cybersecurity landscape,” Danielle Inman, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation, said via email."

Donald Trump threatened to levy 100% tariffs on members of BRICS, an informal consortium of countries including Russia and China, if the group attempts to shift from the U.S. dollar to an alternative currency.

Any countries that back another currency to replace the U.S. dollar will face increased duties and eventually “say goodbye to selling” in the U.S., the president-elect said in a Nov. 30 post on his social media platform Truth Social.

Founded in 2009, BRICS initially included Brazil, Russia, India and China as members when it was created to counter Western influence in the global economy. Since then, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates have joined its ranks.

Several BRICS member companies have been pushing for the use of local currencies for international trade to circumvent U.S. influence. At the group’s annual summit in 2023, Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva urged fellow BRICS countries to establish a common currency, according to a Reuters report.

Trump’s tariff promises come just days after he vowed to to levy a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. Such action would fall in line with his campaign rhetoric as well as tactics employed during his first term from 2017 to 2021."
44,2024-12-02 12:00:00,Manufacturing ‘neared stabilization’ in November: PMI,"Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Manufacturers' showed renewed confidence in the industry's trajectory in November, with companies hiring additional staff, according to S&P Global's U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index.

S&P Global's PMI reading rose to 49.7 last month, buoyed by a slowing in new order decline, with manufacturers pointing to improved demand conditions following Donald Trump's presidential win.

The Institute for Supply Management's PMI registered slightly lower at 48.4%, though still 1.9 percentage points higher compared to October. ISM's reading was also driven by improved demand, with new orders reaching 50.4%, the first time the index has hit growth mode since March.

A reading below 50.0% on a PMI index signals economic contraction.

S&P Global's report noted that the industry ""neared stabilization"" last month with input cost inflation falling to its slowest level in a year as companies plan for growth under the Trump administration.

""The gap between expected future output and actual current output is now the widest seen for a decade if the pandemic is excluded, underscoring the marked divergence between tough current conditions and the mounting expectation of better times to come,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement.

Three manufacturing industries grew in November: ISM Food, beverage and tobacco products; computer and electronic products; and electrical equipment, appliances and components each saw growth in November. Meanwhile, 11 industries contracted in November, in the following order: -Printing and related support activities -Plastics and rubber products -Chemical products -Paper products -Transportation equipment -Fabricated metal products -Furniture and related products -Machinery -Nonmetallic mineral products -Miscellaneous manufacturing -Primary metals

Production also rose slightly last month to 46.8% as demand moderates, and employment rose 3.7 percentage points to 48.1%, according to the ISM.

""Now that the election is over and policies are becoming clearer, panelist companies have more clarity on how to make investment decisions,"" Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM’s manufacturing business survey committee, said on a media call Monday.

On the supply side, lead times improved in November, with deliveries, inventories, prices and imports all pointing to future demand growth, according to the ISM.

Manufacturers are ""upbeat"" about a supportive incoming administration, Fiore said, even if the threat of impending tariffs is causing some uncertainty in the industry. The economist added that manufacturers are treating a possible rise in inflation, which experts say is a possible result of tariff hikes, as a future problem.

""Clearly the business community grabs onto the Republican win, and they've kind of looked at the inflation potential as something we'll deal with in the future. In the meantime, let's get on top of this thing and start the new grow-out,"" Fiore said.

At the industry level, ISM panelists said they expect to return to growth mode in the coming months.

“Business remains slow. We anticipate that the first half of 2025 will be similar and hope that demand increases in the second half of 2025,” wrote one transportation equipment respondent.

Trump's recent promise of 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, the U.S.'s two biggest trading partners, is also not a cause for panic, Fiore said, especially given the previous preparations many companies have made for such moves.

""I don't see [the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] getting blown up. I don't see huge tariffs being put on our partners,"" Fiore said. ""Take a chill pill and I think we'll work through it. Panelist companies are ready for this and we'll see where it goes. Hopefully, if there are tariffs that are put in place with our two big trading partners, they'll be short-lived.”"

The Ministry of Defence is war-gaming a major conflict to ""stress-test"" supplies of ammunition and equipment in a war time scenario. The MoD says it is the first war games to involve representatives of the defence industry – alongside military commanders and officials. The week-long exercise began on Monday morning and is taking place at the Defence Academy in Shrivenham, Oxfordshire. The Defence Secretary John Healey said the reason for the exercise was to ensure government and industry ""are capable of innovation at wartime speed"".

Healey told the BBC the war-gaming would work through ""a range of scenarios in which we may be faced by conflict, we may be faced with protracted fighting and we may be faced with severe disruption in the supply chains"". The war-gaming coincides with the launch of the government’s defence industrial strategy. The defence secretary says the strategy will help create a more innovative and resilient supply chain, and boost British industry. Speaking to the London Defence Conference, Healey said his message was to ""invest in defence and send a strong signal to Putin"" and national security was the foundation for growth. Russia's war in Ukraine has highlighted glaring gaps in Europe's ability to sustain a long conflict, with industry initially slow to respond. In 2021 the former head of the US Army in Europe, Lt Gen Ben Hodges, told MPs the British Army quickly ran out of ammunition in a war-gaming exercise. He said the entire British Army's inventory was exhausted with every bit of important ammunition expended before the 10-day exercise was completed.

46,2024-12-02 09:00:00,TJX: Tariffs provide buying opportunities,"Listen to the article 2 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

TJX believes the possibility of higher tariffs may benefit the business' buying practices, CEO and President Ernie Herrman said on a Nov. 20 earnings call.

Tariffs could prompt vendors and manufacturers to bring goods in early, which would create a surplus of inventory for TJX to acquire at advantageous prices, said Herrman.

The CEO told analysts that market ""chaos"" in certain categories typically leads to an opportunity for TJX.

Dive Insight:

Like many companies, TJX has been tracking potential tariff increases that specifically target China-made goods under the incoming Trump presidential administration. But the discount retailer doesn’t expect its business to be heavily impacted by the possibility.

TJX says that it gains flexibility by not buying inventory so far out in advance. Direct imports also make up a small portion of TJX’s business, and the retailer already started diversifying its sourcing away from China years ago, according to the CEO.

Further, since a bulk of TJX inventory is purchased from other brands, the company lacks “visibility into where those goods are from, nor do we actually want to get involved in that,” said Herrman.

But the CEO noted that it all goes back to the “value gap.” If a brand were to be impacted by tariffs, for instance, and consequently have to raise prices, the SKU price might go up a little. Regardless of the price difference, Herrman said it “will never be an issue” for the company due to TJX's value edge in comparison to other retailers.

“So, while we won't speculate on exactly what will happen with certain items or certain categories, if it does happen, we are set up to ensure that we maintain our value gap between us and the out the door at no matter what those categories are that could get hit with tariffs,” Herrman told analysts.

Several retailers have been preparing for tariff changes, including fashion brand Steve Madden which intends to limit its exposure to China-based sourcing. Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren currently only sources a “single-digit percentage” of its products from China, claiming that its diversified production footprint puts the company in an optimal position."

It is no longer enough for businesses simply to know and hold themselves accountable for their direct actions—what they make, how they make it, whom they buy from and to whom they sell. Geopolitical conflict, climate change, unpredictable supply chain shocks and, by no means least of all, specific government requirements all require businesses to understand and master their multi-tier value chains.

The big question is, how? Advances in artificial intelligence and data science hold the key.

Visibility Across Global Value Chains

The data to build a bottoms-up view of the global supply chain network with the ability to trace and explore specific product value chains exists. It just doesn’t exist in one place, or anything close to that. Instead, it’s scattered and siloed across the globe, in many different languages and data types, and much of it is first-party. But with artificial intelligence, it’s possible to process all of that data and render it into a single clean, unified and dynamic view of the world’s interconnected supply chains.

But that requires pooling everyone’s sensitive data for learning, right? Not anymore. Through federated computing and machine learning, it is possible to overcome the limitations of sharing data, making learning across data silos a possibility.

Federated learning makes it possible to render a dynamic, intelligent, universal map of the entire global supply chain using first-party intelligence from networked participants, all while ensuring data privacy, security and sovereignty for each of those participants. The result is a shared source of truth on the global supply chain, informed by the data of many of the world’s largest organizations, without sharing anyone’s data.

Mastering Your Value Chains

Visibility is only the start. The organizations that benefit from this paradigm shift will be those that truly master their value chains. The combination of new regulatory incentives and emerging technology allows organizations to take command of upstream and downstream visibility, collaboration and action. This is only possible through a shared source of truth from which value chains can be governed across security, sustainability, labor rights, resilience, supply and demand.

This implies a new way of organizing and working across teams in every business. Today, teams are siloed across design and engineering, sourcing, procurement, sales, logistics, compliance, sustainability, global trade management, risk management and finance. Taking control of your value chains requires input and action from all of these stakeholders. And they all need a common operating picture on which to collaborate.

Unfortunately, most business processes—and the software applications supporting them—are not designed to manage value chains. Most software applications can’t even represent the concept of value chains—just items, orders and inventories, and the direct suppliers and customers for both. The whole ecosystem is designed around direct buyer-supplier relationships.

Design and sourcing teams need to know up front whether the product they’re making can be sourced lawfully, the tariff rates that will apply in every market and what its carbon footprint will be. Risk managers and compliance teams need to work with supplier managers to engage their upstream suppliers, remediate compliance exposures and document them for regulators, and transfer risks to the insurance marketplace.

Finance needs to work with the supply chain and logistics teams to understand potential business interruption risks, exposure to fines and carbon border taxes. Executives need to be able to ask the question, ""What would be the impact on our business—our sales and our supplies—if a particular country invades another?""

It is equally essential for companies to work in entirely new ways externally—sharing information and coordinating across both their direct and indirect buyers and suppliers and with their government stakeholders. In fact, they are legally obliged to do so.

Mastering your value chains requires explicit information sharing, coordination and standard-setting beyond direct buyer and supplier relationships. The whole chain from raw materials and intermediate goods to final assembly and consumption will need to be networked.

Businesses are now required to gather and share data across multi-tier value chain partners. They also need to share this information with governments. Governments are taking steps to share their view of the world with the private sector to manage the defense industrial base, secure critical infrastructure and manage borders. Insurers and lenders now need to know the value chain in order to price risk and comply with regulations.

The upside of all this government-compelled change is that it offers a fundamentally more sustainable, resilient and secure model for managing global businesses. The possibilities are enormous. By mastering their value chains, businesses can coordinate supply and demand. The carbon impact of individual products can be measured accurately and reduced.

Critical Western technology can be kept out of the wrong hands, so it doesn’t make its way into foreign hostile drones or missiles. And the government and business can collaborate across a shared source of truth to ensure that trade is both efficient and secure.

In short, by mastering their value chains, businesses can have their cake and eat it too: They can enjoy the security, reliability and coordination of vertical integration without needing to own the entire value chain. We can preserve the benefits of globalization while addressing its side effects and unintended consequences.

[+] if President-elect Donald Trump’s carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. 3d illustration getty

The nation’s fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico.

“These tariffs will inevitably increase costs which we already know, as they act as a tax on imported goods, and very likely will disrupt the flow of trade by adding complexity to customs processes and extending lead times that are already quite long,” Amanda Russo, founder and CEO at Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting, predicted in an email message.

There is a sense of urgency for corporate executives to prepare for the looming crisis. That’s because “once companies experience a supply chain disruption, it takes them an average of two weeks to plan and execute a response,” according to an October report about supply chain vulnerabilities by McKinsey & Company.

Proactive Measures

There are steps business leaders can take now to to prepare for and help lessen the impact of a tariff-fueled crisis as much as possible.

Seek Supply Chain Alternatives

“Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains by making imported components more expensive or less accessible. Companies may need to seek alternative suppliers, which can be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to production delays, Tanya Wade, a senior manager at KPMG, noted via email.

Trump’’s tariffs could also create additional crisis situations.

“Targeted countries may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, affecting American businesses that rely on international markets. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to broader trade conflicts, further destabilizing supply chains,” she pointed out.

Stockpile Inventory

""The first thing businesses may want to do is to bring in inventory early prior to any new tariffs being imposed. This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,” Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

Diversify

""Another way that businesses can proactively mitigate the impact of potentially higher tariffs is by re-evaluating their supply chains and considering strategic diversification of sourcing and production to areas where tariffs are not being imposed,” he counseled.

There could be a silver lining to tariffs for some companies.

""Higher tariffs can also create opportunities for businesses to increase their competitiveness by exploring domestic or near-shore production and forming new partnerships that reduce exposure to tariff-related costs,” Magel concluded.

There is more than one way companies could guard help against the impact of tariffs.

Manage Financial Impact

“Managing the financial impact of tariffs has also become a priority. Businesses are looking for ways to offset increased costs by improving operational efficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or adjusting pricing strategies. Technology plays a growing role in this process, as companies adopt advanced supply chain management tools to monitor risks, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time,” Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management, observed in an email interview.

Plan Ahead

“Another critical step is engaging in proactive planning. Companies are developing contingency strategies to account for a range of tariff scenarios, modeling how different levels of import duties might affect their pricing, demand, and operations. Many are also working with industry groups and policymakers to advocate for exemptions or adjustments that could mitigate the impact on their sectors,” he commented.

Stocking up on inventory now is one way that companies can help protect themselves against a ... [+] tariff-related supply chain crisis. getty





Challenges

The survey by McKinsey & Company that was released in October underscores the major challenges companies face in preparing for supply chain disruptions.

Talent Shortages

“A shortage of talent, particularly digital talent, continues to hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of those surveyed, 90% say that their companies lack sufficient talent to meet their digitization goals. That number hasn’t changed in any meaningful way since the first survey in 2020,” the report observed.

A Lack Of Understanding Of Risk

“The biggest gap could be the one at the top of the organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe that their boards have an in-depth understanding of supply chain risk. Only a quarter have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain issues at board level. All this could leave companies dangerously exposed to future disruptions,” according to the survey results.

Fewer Discussions

“Perhaps more concerning is a steep drop in the frequency that supply chain risks are discussed at a senior-management level. In the 2023 survey, almost one-half of respondents said that their organizations had a regular reporting cadence for supply chain risk. This year, that share dropped to one-quarter, with most companies reverting to ad hoc reporting in response to disruptions or the emergence of major new risks,” the report pointed out.

Going Forward

Don’t Fly Blind

“If you’re not mapping your supply chain down to tier three, four, or five, you’re flying blind. You need to know where your suppliers may feel a tariff crunch,” Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, an AI-powered supply chain management company,” advised in an email interview.

Rethink Supply Chains

“At the end of the day, this isn’t just about tariffs. It’s about rethinking how we build and manage supply chains. It’s about moving from reactive to proactive. Companies that take this moment seriously—invest in resilience, embrace technology, and build partnerships—will not just weather the storm; they’ll come out stronger. This is the time to turn disruption into opportunity,” he commented.

Evolve

“Ultimately, the tariffs underscore the critical need for supply chains to be both resilient and adaptable. Organizations that fail to evolve risk severe disruptions and escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities such as supplier dependency and reliance on manual processes, companies can better position themselves to thrive in an unpredictable trade landscape,” Amanda Russo of Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies and organizations have faced a number of supply chain crises over the years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal by a cargo container ship, and the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Businesses who don’t take steps now to protect themselves as much as possible from a tariff-related supply chain crisis will only have themselves to blame if and when it—or another crisis—strikes."
49,NaN,‘Italian’ purees likely to contain Chinese forced-labour tomatoes,"‘Italian’ purees in UK supermarkets likely to contain Chinese forced-labour tomatoes

“Italian” tomato purees sold by several UK supermarkets appear to contain tomatoes grown and picked in China using forced labour, the BBC has found. Some have “Italian” in their name such as Tesco’s “Italian Tomato Purée”. Others have “Italian” in their description, such as Asda’s double concentrate which says it contains “Puréed Italian grown tomatoes” - and Waitrose’s “Essential Tomato Purée”, describing itself as “Italian tomato puree”. A total of 17 products, most of them own-brands sold in UK and German retailers, are likely to contain Chinese tomatoes - testing commissioned by the BBC World Service shows. Most Chinese tomatoes come from the Xinjiang region, where their production is linked to forced labour by Uyghur and other largely Muslim minorities. The UN accuses the Chinese state - which views these minorities as a security risk - of torture and abuse. China denies it forces people to work in the tomato industry and says workers’ rights are protected by law. It says the UN report is based on “disinformation and lies”. All the supermarkets whose products we tested dispute our findings.

Alamy China grows most of its tomatoes in the Xinjiang region

China grows about a third of the world’s tomatoes. The north-western region of Xinjiang has the perfect climate for growing the fruit. It is also where China began a programme of mass detentions in 2017. Human rights groups allege more than a million Uyghurs have been detained in hundreds of facilities, which China has termed “re-education camps”. The BBC has spoken to 14 people who say they endured or witnessed forced labour in Xinjiang’s tomato fields over the past 16 years. “[The prison authorities] told us the tomatoes would be exported overseas,” Ahmed (not his real name) said, adding that if the workers did not meet the quotas - as much as 650kg a day - they would be shocked with electric prods. Mamutjan, a Uyghur teacher who was imprisoned in 2015 for an irregularity in his travel documentation, says he was beaten for failing to meet the high tomato quotas expected of him. “In a dark prison cell, there were chains hanging from the ceiling. They hung me up there and said ‘Why can’t you finish the job?’ They beat my buttocks really hard, hit me in the ribs. I still have marks.”

Mamutjan, who picked tomatoes in detention, says he was hung from the ceiling of his cell as punishment for not picking enough of the fruit

It is hard to verify these accounts, but they are consistent, and echo evidence in a 2022 UN report which reported torture and forced labour in detention centres in Xinjiang. By piecing together shipping data from around the world, with the non-profit organisation C4ADS, the BBC discovered how most Xinjiang tomatoes are transported into Europe - by train through Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and into Georgia, from where they are shipped onwards to Italy.

One company name repeatedly appeared as a recipient in the data. This was Antonio Petti, part of a group of major tomato-processing firms in Italy. It received more than 36 million kg of tomato paste from the company Xinjiang Guannong and its subsidiaries between 2020 and 2023, the data showed. The Petti group produces tomato goods under its own name, but also supplies others to supermarkets across Europe who sell them as their own branded products. Our investigation tested 64 different tomato purees sold in the UK, Germany and the US - comparing them in a lab to samples from China and Italy. They included top Italian brands and supermarket own-brands, and many were produced by Petti. We asked Source Certain, a world-renowned origin verification firm based in Australia, to investigate whether the origin claims on the purees’ labels were accurate. The company began by building what its CEO Cameron Scadding calls a “fingerprint” which is unique to a country of origin - analysing the trace elements which the tomatoes absorb from local water and rocks. “The first objective for us was to establish what the underlying trace element profile would look like for China, and [what] a likely profile would look like for Italy. We found they were very distinct,” he said. Source Certain then compared those country profiles with the 64 tomato purees we wanted to test - the majority of which claimed to contain Italian tomatoes or gave the impression they did - and a few which did not make any origin claim. The lab results suggested many of these products did indeed contain Italian tomatoes - including all those sold in the US, top Italian brands including Mutti and Napolina, and some German and UK supermarket own-brands, including those sold by Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer. But 17 appeared to contain Chinese tomatoes, 10 of which are made by Petti - the Italian company we found listed repeatedly in international shipping records. Of those 10 made by Petti, these were for sale in UK supermarkets at the time of testing from April-August 2024:

These were for sale in German supermarkets, during our testing period:

In response, all the supermarkets said they took these allegations very seriously and have carried out internal investigations which found no evidence of Chinese tomatoes. Many have also disputed the testing methodology used by our experts. Tesco suspended supply and Rewe immediately withdrew the products. Waitrose, Morrisons, Edeka and Rewe said they had run their own tests, and that the results contradicted ours and did not show the presence of Chinese tomatoes in the products. But one major retailer has admitted to using Chinese tomatoes. Lidl told us they were in another version of its Baresa Tomatenmark - made by the Italian supplier Giaguaro - sold in Germany last year “for a short time” because of supply problems and that they are investigating this. Giaguaro said all its suppliers respected workers' rights and it is currently not using Chinese tomatoes in Lidl products. The BBC understands the tomatoes were supplied by the Xinjiang company Cofco Tunhe, which the US sanctioned in December last year for forced labour. In 2021, one of the Petti group’s factories was raided by the Italian military police on suspicion of fraud - it was reported by the Italian press that Chinese and other foreign tomatoes were passed off as Italian. But a year after the raid, the case was settled out of court. Petti denied the allegations about Chinese tomatoes and the issue was dropped. As part of our investigation into Petti, a BBC undercover reporter posed as a businessman wanting to place a large order with the firm. Invited to tour a company factory in Tuscany by Pasquale Petti, the General Manager of Italian Food, part of the Petti group, our reporter asked him if Petti used Chinese tomatoes. “Yes… In Europe no-one wants Chinese tomatoes. But if for you it’s OK, we will find a way to produce the best price possible, even using Chinese tomatoes,” he said.

Petti sent us what it said was its last invoice from Xinjiang Guannong (l) dated October 2020, but our undercover reporter spotted a label on a barrel sent to Petti dated August 2023

The reporter’s undercover camera also captured a crucial detail - a dozen blue barrels of tomato paste lined up inside the factory. A label visible on one of them read: “Xinjiang Guannong Tomato Products Co Ltd, prod date 2023-08-20.” In its response to our investigation, the Petti group told us it had not bought from Xinjiang Guannong since that company was sanctioned by the US for using forced labour in 2020, but did say that it had regularly purchased tomato paste from a Chinese company called Bazhou Red Fruit. This firm “did not engage in forced labour”, Petti told us. However our investigation has found that Bazhou Red Fruit shares a phone number with Xinjiang Guannong, and other evidence, including shipping data analysis, suggests that Bazhou is its shell company. Petti added that: “In future we will not import tomato products from China and will enhance our monitoring of suppliers to ensure compliance with human and workers’ rights.” While the US has introduced strict legislation to ban all Xinjiang exports, Europe and the UK take a softer approach, allowing companies simply to self-regulate to ensure forced labour is not used in supply chains. This is now set to change in the EU, which has committed to stronger laws, says Chloe Cranston, from the NGO Anti-Slavery International. But she warns this will make it even more likely that the UK will become “a dumping ground” for forced labour products."
50,NaN,Trump praises 'very productive' Mar-a-Lago meeting with Trudeau,"Trump praises 'very productive' Mar-a-Lago meeting with Trudeau

He later wrote on X: ""Thanks for dinner last night, President Trump. I look forward to the work we can do together, again.""

Earlier on Saturday, Trudeau told reporters he had an ""excellent conversation"" with the American president-elect but declined to answer any questions.

The men discussed ""many important topics"", Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, including fentanyl, illegal immigration, and trade.

Donald Trump said he had a ""very productive meeting"" with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, after the two leaders met at Trump's Florida estate Mar-a-Lago.

Trudeau travelled to West Palm Beach as Canada seeks to head off the president-elect's threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, a source has confirmed to the BBC.

Canadian media reported that Trudeau landed in Palm Beach International Airport on Friday evening to visit Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

The two spoke by phone earlier in the week after Trump announced that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff on all products entering the US from Mexico and Canada.

But much of Trump's Saturday afternoon statement following the meeting focused on the ""drug crisis that has decimated so many lives"".

""I made it very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic, caused mainly by the Drug Cartels, and Fentanyl pouring in from China,"" Trump wrote.

""Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation.""

Neither the prime minister's office nor Trump's team responded to the BBC's request for comment on the visit.

Leaving his hotel in Palm Beach on Saturday morning, Trudeau ignored questions from reporters about whether he and Trump had discussed potential tariffs.

The trip was not included on Trudeau's public itinerary for Friday.

Trump has been at his Mar-a-Lago estate meeting with his transition team. Trudeau is reported to be the first G7 leader to visit the president-elect since the election.

The two men reportedly had dinner, alongside Trump's pick for commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and Canada's public safety minister Dominic LeBlanc.

Trudeau has often underscored that the two countries were able to successfully renegotiate a major trade pact during Trump's first term, though the relationship between the two leaders has occasionally been rocky.

On Friday, speaking at an event in Prince Edward Island, Trudeau said the two countries ""rolled up our sleeves and were able to create jobs on both sides of the border"".

He said looked forward to having many ""great"" conversations with Trump.

The Florida visit is the latest move by Canada as it seeks to avoid the hefty tariffs, which could have wide-reaching economic impacts.

It remains unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will actually move ahead with the threatened tariffs, as analysts note that the president-elect has been known to use such threats in the past as a negotiating tactic to achieve his goals.

Trump - who has also threatened the same levy against Mexico - has signalled that they would remain in place until both countries work to secure their shared borders with the US.

Trudeau said on Friday that ""when Trump makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out"".

He said his goal was to point out the tariff would not just harm Canadians but also raise prices for Americans and hurt that country's economy.

Trudeau was accompanied on the trip by Dominic LeBlanc, the minister in charge of border security.

US media reported that Trudeau and Trump were joined at dinner by Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary; Doug Burgum, tapped to lead the Department of the Interior; and Mike Waltz, who has been selected as the next national security adviser.

Canada is one of America's largest trading partners and it sends about 75% of its total exports to the US. The two countries also share deeply integrated supply chains.

After the phone call with Trump, Trudeau held an emergency meeting on Wednesday with the leaders of Canada's provinces and territories over how to manage the US-Canada relationship.

Trudeau is promising to present a united ""Team Canada"" approach to working with the US to make the case against the levy.

Several leaders of Canadian provinces have criticised Trump's plan, saying it would be devastating to the country's economy, including the oil and gas and automotive industries.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also had a phone call with Trump this week.

The number of crossings at the US-Canada border is significantly lower than that at the southern border, according to US Border Patrol data on migrant encounters.

During the 2024 fiscal year, there were around 23,700 apprehensions at the northern land border, while the southern border saw more than 1.53 million apprehensions.

But Canadian officials have said in recent days there is still joint work to be done to improve border security."
51,NaN,World Beekeeping Awards axe honey prize due to fraud,"World Beekeeping Awards axe honey prize due to fraud

This decision comes after previous years' events proved that ""adequate testing was impossible"" as well as recent investigations which showed the sticky situation that importers have found themselves in.

Apimondia - the International Federation of Beekeepers’ Associations - said in a statement that the change was ""necessitated by the inability to have honey fully tested for adulteration"".

It'll be the first time that the popular cupboard staple has been excluded from the event.

The World Beekeeping Awards have announced that there will not be any prizes for honey next year because of concerns about fraud in the global supply chain.

In March 2023, the European Commission found that 46% of sampled products (including all 10 samples from the UK) were suspected to be fraudulent - meaning they had likely been bulked out with cheaper sugar syrups.

Scientists at Cranfield University then said in August this year that they had found a way to detect fake honey products without opening the jar.

Project leader, Dr Anastasiadi, said: ""Our study showed this is a sensitive, reliable and robust way to detect adulteration and confirm the origins of syrups.

""Having this consistent technique in the testing armoury could take the sting out of honey fraud.""

It's too soon to make any promises for the World Beekeeping Awards at the 2025 Congress, though Apimondia said it still planned to celebrate honey in many ways.

""From Copenhagen forward we will look to celebrate honey by promoting regional honeys via a 'honey map'”.

This map will supposedly allow beekeepers, scientists and interested parties alike to ""discover the unique flavours of Scandinavian honeys. Explore how the (unique) geographical and climatic conditions in Scandinavia influence the taste of honey and get to know the stories behind the honey from [this] region.""

Jeff Pettis, the federation’s president, said that they were ""continuing to fight for improvements to the testing"" and that he wanted ""the public to know that local honey is much less likely to be adulterated.""

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “We take any type of food fraud very seriously. We work closely with enforcement authorities to ensure that honey sold in the UK is not subject to adulteration, meets our high standards, and maintains a level playing field between honey producers.”"
52,2024-11-29 00:00:00,'Crazy growth': How one product created a multi-million dollar brand,"'Crazy growth': How one product created a multi-million dollar brand

Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.

At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing – it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.

The company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress – now with over 50 designs – to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.

""Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 – right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,"" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. ""I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.

EXECUTIVE LOUNGE The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here.

""Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.""

Since then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (£118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.

The company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.

""We've had the biggest year in company history,"" Diamond said. ""The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.""

When we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying

Diamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.

""I was always drawn to retail,"" she says. ""I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure – loving fashion – turned out to be a viable career opportunity.""

Now, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.

I wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing – great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

There were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and … start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.

By 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.

Hill House Home The Nap Dress has proved wildly popular with consumers, with new collections often selling out in minutes of going on sale (Credit: Hill House Home)

Why do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?

It's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day – it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.

When we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: ""Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it."" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.

What are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?

There were – and continues to be – challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.

In 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.

But when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base – we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.

How do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?

We have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.

Zac Frackelton Nell Diamond began her career in finance but switched to retail to follow her real passion (Credit: Zac Frackelton)

You've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?

I can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.

By the numbers 1 million nap dresses sold 50 styles of the Nap Dress 5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas 80 employees ~$150m valuation

How have you been expanding the brand?

We have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.

The home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim – and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.

The fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?

We focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.

I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way

What advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?

One of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: ""We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?"" That was never productive for me.

I had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.

Where do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?

My perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.

I'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].

53,NaN,Typhoo Tea falls into adminstration,"Typhoo Tea falls into administration as sales slide

Typhoo has been trying to turn itself around for some time, but it suffered a setback after trespassers damaged its former factory in Moreton, Merseyside last year.

Vape and battery maker Supreme is front runner to buy Typhoo, but it said there was ""no certainty"" a deal will go ahead.

Advisory firm Kroll has been appointed to handle the administration and find a buyer for the tea business.

Typhoo Tea has fallen into administration as the 120-year-old brand's sales slump, losses widen and debts rise.

""The company has been exploring a sale of the business and assets which is in the process of concluding,"" Kroll said.

""The administration process provides Typhoo Tea with protection, allowing the Joint Administrators to finalise the sale in order to rescue the business.""

Manchester-based Supreme, which stocks and distributes Duracell and Energiser batteries as well as Elf Bar vapes, is on the cusp of buying the firm in an attempt to diversify its business.

It does not currently stock or distribute any tea brands, but it does work with brands of soft drinks, gym supplements and multivitamin gummies.

Supreme said talks were at an ""advanced stage"" but that ""no final terms of the potential acquisition have been agreed"".

Kroll added that Typhoo had been dealing with ""significant cash flow constraints as a result of supply chain disruptions and subsequent service issues"".

According to the firm's latest results, which cover the year to the end of September 2023, pre-tax losses widened to £38m from £9.6m and sales fell to £25.3m from £33.7m.

Meanwhile, the company's debts have ballooned to greater than the value of its assets.

The results also revealed £24.1m worth of ""exceptional costs"", some of which relate to the break-in at the Moreton plant, which was shut down last year.

Typhoo said: ""During August 2023, a group of organised trespassers broke into the Moreton site and occupied it for several days.""

It added that the trespassers caused ""extensive damage"" and made the site ""inaccessible"".

Typhoo said a lot of tea was rendered unusable and it was unable to fulfil some orders to customers."
54,2024-11-28 00:00:00,China’s EV price war is so brutal that BYD is trying to pinch its suppliers,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

China’s top maker of electric vehicles (EV) wants to pay a lot less for car parts in the new year, a demand that signals there is no end in sight to a vicious price war nor economic gloom marked by lower wages and uncertain prospects.

BYD, Tesla’s main rival, asked a supplier to cut its prices by 10% next year, in widely circulated screenshots of a letter dated Tuesday and signed by He Zhiqi, an executive vice president at the Shenzhen-based company.

“In 2025, while there will be great opportunities in the EV market, market competition will also become more intense, entering a decisive battle and knockout rounds,” he wrote. “In order to enhance the competitiveness of BYD passenger cars, we need the entire supply chain to work together and continue to reduce costs.”

CNN has reached out to BYD for comment and has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the letter.

However, on Wednesday, Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, appeared to acknowledge the letter with a post on his verified account on social media platform Weibo.

“Annual price negotiations with suppliers are a common practice in the car industry,” he wrote. “We set price reduction targets for suppliers. It is not mandatory, and everyone can negotiate.”

For 15 years, China’s car market has been the world’s biggest. But starting two years ago, when Tesla kicked off a price war by slashing prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars in the country by as much as 9%, it has also become the world’s most competitive, with observers calling it a “life and death race.”

China’s more than 200 EV manufacturers are now grappling with huge oversupply, and experts predict many smaller companies will not survive the fierce competition. It’s not looking more optimistic for makers of vehicles with internal combustion engines either.

A letter from Maxus, a carmaker under state-owned SAIC Motor, circulating online earlier this week also asked for a price cut of 10%, citing a need to “improve survival” amid a “complex situation.” CNN has reached out to the company for comment.

“Market leaders (are) willing to sacrifice margins in order to gain share in the race to an electric future,” said Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility. “BYD has been most aggressive as they seek to leverage their vertically integrated supply chain and cost advantage to lock in their dominance in the market. Others will try to keep pace.”

Even the mightiest

The ongoing competition, imposition of additional tariffs by the European Union and uncertainty over the incoming Trump administration potentially igniting a global trade war means China’s EV makers may have little choice but to cut costs where they can, according to Tu Le, managing director at Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm.

“This means the price war … is really stressing the system,” he said. “And that even the mightiest of OEMs is feeling vulnerable.”

OEM refers to original equipment manufacturers, an industry term that describes car makers such as Ford and General Motors. BYD is China’s top carmaker, commanding 16.2% of the overall vehicle market in the first 10 months of the year, according to the China Passenger Car Association. It had 36.1% of the market for EVs over the same period.

A major concern was that price cuts would “stretch suppliers too thin,” Le added, since they are “normally a fraction of the size of OEMs and don’t have access to capital like the OEMs do.”

Concern about the impact of the price cuts on people’s livelihoods during an economic slump made BYD one of the top trending topics on Weibo on Thursday, with a total of 19 million views. Commentators speculated that numerous suppliers in the car industry would inevitably have to slash salaries in an already grim job market in the new year.

“Exploiting the supply chain is their best skill, not treating grassroots employees as humans,” said a post with more than 1,000 likes.

Shares in Chongqing Sulian Plastic, a BYD supplier that sells fuel pipelines and other automotive parts, fell by more than 3% over two trading sessions this week since the emergence of the letter. Another supplier, Alnera Aluminium, which makes aluminum alloy parts for EV battery systems, has seen its stock drop by 4% over the same period."

BBC Handbag designer Sherrill Mosee says Trump's tariff threats are already having an impact

When handbag designer Sherrill Mosee learned that roughly 2,700 purses and backpacks she had ordered from her Chinese manufacturing partner would not make it onto one ship this autumn, she was initially content to wait. Then Donald Trump was re-elected as US president. ""I'm like, okay, we've got to bring those in,"" said Ms Mosee, founder of MinkeeBlue, a small business based in Philadelphia. Her firm is one of the many thousands across the country preparing for the potential impact of Trump's promises to impose stiff new tariffs on all goods coming into the country. Those efforts gained urgency this week as Trump said he would take action on his first day in office. He aimed the measures - a kind of border tax - at China, Mexico and Canada, America's top three trade partners.

Writing on social media, Trump said he planned to impose a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico and ""an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs"" on imports from China. The post followed his campaign pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of at least 10% on all imports coming into the US, and 60% or more on goods from China - many of which already face steep duties left over from actions taken during his first term as president. Some experts have said that Trump's policies may ultimately prove less aggressive than promised, and that his statements should be understood as opening salvos in bigger negotiations of migration and drug policy. But regardless of how policy shakes out, the threats are already having economic consequences, as firms like MinkeeBlue start to stockpile, shift supply chains, re-work contracts and take other steps to guard against the possible impact.

Chris Caton, managing director for global strategy and analytics at warehouse giant Prologis, said his firm had already seen an uptick in activity ""on the margin"" as businesses respond to possible tariffs by looking for space to stock up. ""There's economic impact whether it's bluster or not,"" said economist Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In the days after the election, footwear giant Steve Madden told investors that it was moving forward with plans to shift manufacturing outside of China, with the aim of cutting its imports from the country in half over the next year. Tool and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker also said it had initiated conversations with its customers about price hikes tied to the tariffs. Executives at retail giants such as Walmart have discussed similar plans. Even if Trump's policies remain just talk, Ms Edelberg said the public could see higher prices, as well as possible shortages of some items, as hoarding left some firms scrambling. Just the simple fact that firms were unsure about what was going to happen was also likely to reduce economic growth in the months ahead, she added. ""Even if firms don't think that these tariffs are going to happen with 100% certainty, it's not zero, so they should be responding,"" Ms Edelberg said.

Trump and his advisers have argued that tariffs will help revive US manufacturing and drive a new US jobs boom. But that can come at a cost, businesses owners and economists warn. Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Canadian solar panel maker Heliene, said his firm was nearly wiped out in 2018 when Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made solar panels and it had to absorb the fees. The firm now does all of its manufacturing in the US, where it employs 400 people. Many of its suppliers have also set up shop in the US, lured by government incentives for renewable energy introduced by President Joe Biden. Mr Pochtaruk's firm has learned from its experience, changing the design of its contracts so that customers are responsible for unexpected cost changes - whether due to tariffs or the kind of price spikes that hit during the pandemic. But despite these protections, the possibility of renewed trade tension between countries as closely connected as Canada and the US was worrying, Mr Pochtaruk said. Some key materials - such as glass - still come from overseas and face likely price hikes. The new administration could also bring other policies that slow growth in the industry. ""We are talking to all of our clients,"" Mr Pochtaruk said. ""There is a lot of anxiety.""

Economists say the evidence from existing tariffs - which have been present for decades in sectors such as clothing and footwear - suggests that while they can protect some firms, the cost is high and they do little to boost overall employment, while raising prices for US companies and consumers. The National Retail Federation (NRF) has warned that tariffs along the lines of Trump's campaign proposals would cost US consumers between $46bn (£36.6bn) and $78bn more annually for apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods. By NRF estimates, a $40 toaster, for example, would rise in price to $48-$52, while a $50 pair of athletic shoes could jump to $59-$64. Trump's move on Monday to target Mexico - a key supplier of grocery staples such as fruits and vegetables and historically protected by a free-trade agreement - underscores the tension between his tariff promises and other pledges on the campaign trail to bring down prices for Americans. Viktor Shvets of Macquarie Capital said that although Trump's ideas were in conflict with each other, he believed in the end Trump's fear of disrupting financial markets would limit his trade actions. ""Risks are high, but we remain convinced that 'guardrails' are sufficiently robust to avoid the worst outcomes,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Such bets are little comfort to small business owners like Ms Mosee, who have little extra financial cushion to weather uncertainty. As a small brand facing significant competition, Ms Mosee said she was not in a strong position to raise prices on her bags, which typically sell for about $180 a piece. She has been looking in Cambodia and India for a new supplier. But after a decade on her own, Ms Mosee - a former engineer who has decorated her office with motivational posters promising that ""something wonderful is about to happen"" - said she probably needed to find a business partner if her business, with its two employees, was to survive the expected changes ahead. ""It's going to be hard,"" she said. ""It's going to be hard all the way around."""

Reuters

Donald Trump says he will hit China, Mexico and Canada with new tariffs on day one of his presidency, in an effort to force them to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the US. The US president-elect said he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada, after being inaugurated on 20 January 2025. He also said ""we will be charging China an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs"" until it cracked down on fentanyl smuggling. The threat could mark a major escalation in tensions with the US's three top trading partners. It could also lead to higher prices for Americans, since tariffs work as a form of tax on imports.

The US is the world's largest importer. China, Mexico and Canada account for about 40% of the $3.2tn (£2.6tn) of goods it imports each year, according to official data. China has defended its efforts to stop the flow of illegal drugs, and has warned that there can be no winner in a trade war between the two. After Trump made his tariff threat, he spoke to Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for about 10 minutes, discussing trade and border security, a Canadian government official told the BBC. They had a ""good discussion"", the source said. During the call, Trudeau pointed out that the number of migrants crossing the Canadian border was much smaller compared to the US-Mexico border, the official said. Mexico's finance ministry said: ""Mexico is the United States' top trade partner, and the USMCA provides a framework of certainty for national and international investors.""

The measures have the potential to cause disruptions to the global supply chain and would hit the three countries targeted by the tariffs hard. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada will remain in place until the two countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants illegally crossing the border, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,"" he wrote. ""It is time for them to pay a very big price!"" In a follow-up Truth Social post, Trump attacked Beijing for failing to follow through on promises that he said Chinese officials made to carry out the death penalty for people caught dealing fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the BBC ""the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality"". ""China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature. No one will win a trade war or a tariff war,"" he added. The Biden administration has been calling on Beijing to do more to stop the production of ingredients used in fentanyl, which Washington estimates killed almost 75,000 Americans last year. During his election campaign, Trump threatened Mexico and China with tariffs of up to 100%, if he deemed them necessary, much higher than those he put in place during his first term in office. Trump has also said he will end China's most-favoured-nation trading status with the US - the most advantageous terms Washington offers on tariffs and other restrictions. Last year, more than 80% of Mexico's exports went to the US, while around 75% of Canada's went to its southern neighbour. Even after years of a bitter trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, the US still accounts for about 15% of China's exports.

How do tariffs work?

A tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import. So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. He has previously claimed that these taxes are ""not going to be a cost to you, it’s a cost to another country"". This is almost universally regarded by economists as misleading. The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them. So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government. Trump imposed a number of tariffs in his first term of office, many of which have been kept in place by his successor, President Joe Biden. Economic studies suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers. It was not immediately clear whether Trump's ""additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs"" earmarked for China were on top of the 25% he was planning for Canada and Mexico.

What is Trump's strategy?

The move is ""clearly consistent with his promise that he made during the campaign to utilise tariffs as a weapon to accomplish many of his policy initiatives,"" Stephen Roach, Senior Fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center of Yale Law School, told the BBC's Business Today programme. Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has previously suggested that the president-elect's threats to impose major tariff hikes were part of his negotiating strategy. “My general view is that at the end of the day, he's a free trader,"" Bessent said of Trump in an interview with the Financial Times before he was nominated for the role. “It’s escalate to de-escalate.” It comes as the Chinese economy is in a significantly more vulnerable position than it was during the previous Trump presidency. The country has been struggling with a number of serious issues, including an ongoing property market crisis, weak domestic demand and growing local government debt. The new tariffs appear to break the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade. The deal, which Trump signed into law, took effect in 2020. It continued a largely duty-free trading relationship between the three neighbouring countries. Outside the official reaction from the three countries affected, the response has been critical. Doug Ford, the premier of the Canadian province of Ontario, said Trump's planned tariff would be ""devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the US"". Leader of the Mexican senate, Gerardo Fernández, asked: ""What tariffs should we impose on their [America's] goods until they stop consuming drugs and illegally exporting weapons to our homeland?"""

President-elect Donald Trump on Monday promised massive hikes in tariffs on goods coming from Mexico, Canada and China starting on the first day of his administration, a policy that could sharply increase costs for American businesses and consumers.

The move, Trump said, will be in retaliation for illegal immigration and “crime and drugs” coming across the border.

“On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”

Trump said America’s neighbors can “easily solve this long simmering problem.”

Similarly, Trump said that China will face higher tariffs on its goods – by 10% above any existing tariffs – until it prevents the flow of illegal drugs into the United States.

“I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

The president-elect claimed in the post that Chinese officials promised him the country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States but “never followed through.”

Responding to Trump’s announcement, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said his country has been in communication with the US about counternarcotics operations and that “the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality.”

“About the issue of US tariffs on China, China believes that China-Us economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature. No one will win a trade war or a tariff war,” Liu said in a statement to CNN.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum responded Tuesday, warning the president-elect that “neither threats nor tariffs will solve the issue of migration or drug consumption.”

“Imposing one tariff would mean another comes in response, continuing like this until we put shared companies at risk,” she said, reading from a letter addressed to Trump.

Canadian officials responded to the announcement in a statement posted to X on Monday night, saying that their country “places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of our shared border” and is “essential to US domestic energy supply.”

“We will of course continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration,” Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in the statement.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump shortly after his social media post, an official with the prime minister’s office said. The brief call was focused on border security and trade, a senior Canadian government source told CNN. They characterized the call as productive and said that Trudeau and Trump promised to stay in touch in the days to come.

Trudeau confirmed the call in Ottawa before arriving at a Cabinet meeting, saying, “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on and that’s what we’ll do.”

“We obviously talked about laying out the facts, talking about how, how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth,” Trudeau said. “We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together and it was a good call. It’s something that we can do laying out the facts moving forward in constructive ways.”

A significant policy change

The punishing tariffs, if enacted, could wreak havoc on America’s supply chains and industries reliant on goods from the country’s closest trading partners.

“The measures proposed this evening could hit a number of strategic US industrial sectors hard, add approximately $272 billion a year to tax burdens, raise goods prices, lift interest rates, and sap strength in an already-vulnerable household sector,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions.

Immediately after the announcement, the Canadian dollar fell 1.2% against the US dollar, and the Mexican peso fell 2% against the dollar, but both recovered some of their losses Tuesday morning. China’s yuan, though controlled by the government, traded higher – above 7.6% – in offshore markets.

Although investors believed the tariffs could ultimately strengthen the dollar, America’s financial markets took a hit, too. The extraordinary tariffs would raise costs dramatically for Americans for everyday goods that had previously come over the border without any import taxes.

That stunning shift could stymie economic growth, especially if inflation-weary consumers spend less in the face of higher costs.

The Dow fell 50 points, or 0.1%, Tuesday. The broader S&P 500 and Nasdaq were slightly higher.

What America imports

The United States’ top import from Canada is oil, which reached a record 4.3 million barrels per day in July, according to the US Energy Information Administration. America also imports cars, machinery and other various commodities, plastics and wood from Canada, according to the United Nations’ Comtrade.

America imports the majority of its cars and car parts from Mexico, which surpassed China as the top exporter to the US in 2023, according to trade data released by the Commerce Department earlier this year. Mexico is also a major supplier of electronics, machinery, oil and optical apparatus, and a significant amount of furniture and alcohol comes from the country into the United States.

The United States imports a significant amount of electronics from China, in addition to machinery, toys, games, sports equipment, furniture and plastics.

During Trump’s first term, CNN reported that he implemented tariffs on about $380 billion worth of goods that applied to thousands of Chinese-made products, including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. The Trump tariffs also hit foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels.

Many US imports from Canada and Mexico are exempted from tariffs because of the USMCA trade agreement between the three nations that Trump pushed for during his first administration. It’s not clear how Trump would plan to implement the proposed tariffs without violating the USMCA.

Trump has routinely referenced the passage of the USMCA, which replaced NAFTA, as a political victory and a highlight of his presidency.

Trump’s tariff plan

Trump campaigned on using tariffs as a cudgel against foreign countries – as he did in his first administration – to grow domestic manufacturing while increasing tax revenue to pay for large revenue gaps that his proposed tax cut plan would create.

Tariffs effectively serve as a tax on goods imported to the United States. Although Trump has repeatedly said targeted foreign countries pay the tariffs, they are in fact paid by companies that purchase the imported goods – and those costs are typically passed onto American consumers. Most mainstream economists believe tariffs will be inflationary, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump’s proposed tariffs (before the new tariffs announced Monday night) would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year.

Scott Bessent, Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, has said that tariffs would not add to inflation if they are implemented correctly. Wall Street cheered Bessent’s appointment, because he is widely expected to roll out tariffs gradually.

Although Bessent, if confirmed by the Senate, will be partly responsible for implementing the tariffs, in coordination with the Commerce secretary and US Trade Representative, Trump as president would wield significant power to levy tariffs with the stroke of a pen. He did just that when he was last in the White House, placing large tariffs on goods, primarily from China.

The problem with tariffs is that they often result in retaliatory actions by targeted countries, kicking off a trade war – and that’s exactly what happened during Trump’s first term. That blunted the tariffs’ effect on domestic manufacturing, because manufacturers’ goods became less attractive to overseas buyers.

Trump has promised significantly larger tariffs during his second term. Although he continues to discuss many different numbers, he has proposed a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese goods, as well as an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on all other imports into the US.

Donald Trump plans to use an executive order to levy a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico on day one in office, the president-elect posted on Truth Social on Monday.

These new threats also include a promised additional 10% tariff on goods from China and build on Trump’s campaign promises to impose aggressive tariffs to entice companies to establish production hubs in the U.S. The Biden administration finalized tariff hikes on some China-made goods in September.

In the leadup to the Nov. 5 election, Trump consistently said he would raise tariffs on China-made goods to 60% while implementing an up to 20% tariff on imports generally.

The moves could put the country back on a path towards the trade war it waged during Trump’s first presidency, when the president imposed tariffs on goods from multiple countries, including Canada, Mexico and China.

Also at stake as Trump reenters office is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The 2018 trade deal put a halt to tensions between the North American countries, but the agreement is up for review in 2026.

“If President Trump proceeds with imposing immediate and unilateral tariffs, it could escalate tensions and effectively ‘go nuclear’ on USMCA,” Alberto Villareal, managing director of business consulting firm Nepanoa, wrote in a LinkedIn post Monday. “In response, Mexico and Canada might retaliate with tariffs on U.S. exports before revisiting the agreement.”

Retaliatory tariffs from Mexico and Canada would impact goods such as produce and chemicals, according to Villareal.

Increased tariffs could also harm U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers.

Even prior to Trump’s Monday announcement, new tariffs were projected to increase inflation and cost American shoppers up to $78 billion in spending power each year, per the National Retail Federation. Tariff hikes would also be “devastating” for manufacturers that import foreign components, according to Sanjay Patnaik, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Furthermore, tariffs could push companies to create standalone supply chains to export to the U.S., Mary Lovely, an Anthony M. Solomon senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said during a Nov. 20 press briefing with the Port of Los Angeles.

With less than two months before Trump retakes office, companies are already preparing for increased duties. Some, like Williams-Sonoma, Steve Madden and Ralph Lauren, are proactively reducing their sourcing from China, while others like Honda and Traeger are shifting their production strategies."

62,2024-11-22 00:00:00,TJ Maxx says Trump’s tariff ‘chaos’ will help the chain,"New York CNN —

Companies and economists warn that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to slap tariffs on all US imports will cause havoc in supply chains and raise prices for customers. But TJ Maxx believes that Trump’s tariff plans will benefit the discount chain.

TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, said Wednesday that the “chaos” Trump’s tariffs may bring to the retail industry plays right into its business model. Tariffs are taxes placed on imported goods designed to protect domestic manufacturers. Companies that import products pay the taxes and typically pass the extra cost on to customers in the form of higher prices.

Unlike most brands and retailers, TJX says it only imports a small, undisclosed percentage of its merchandise from factories overseas. Instead, TJX relies mostly on buying designer brands’ excess merchandise straight from the brands, much of it after it’s already been imported — and then selling it to customers anywhere from 20% to 60% below regular prices. TJX’s “opportunistic buying” strategy capitalizes on supply chain disruptions, canceled orders and overproduction. And if an item is already in the US, any potential tariff would have already been paid by the first importer.

TJX believes that Trump’s planned tariffs will create more opportunities to scoop up designer goods as companies race to bring in products early to avoid tariffs. More goods are expected to be imported into the US than normal for the remainder of this year as retailers face a potential resumption of the East Coast port strike, as well as tariff increases, the National Retail Federation said earlier this month. Imports are forecast to grow 13.6% in November from last year and 6.1% in December.

“Manufacturers could bring in goods early,” TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday following the company’s strong sales and profit growth during its latest quarter. “That could create even additional availability of goods at advantageous prices for us.”

“That’s as likely a scenario as anything,” he said.

That’s exactly what happened for TJX in 2019, when the Trump administration hiked tariffs to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Herrman said at the time that tariffs created “buying opportunities” for TJX.

This time around, Trump has proposed a 20% tariff across the board on all US imports and even steeper duties of 60% on goods from China and other major trading partners. That policy could cost the typical middle-income US household more than $2,600 per year, according to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

TJX’s message on tariffs stands in sharp contrast to other retailers that rely more on imported products. Walmart and Lowe’s said this week that they may have to raise prices if Trump’s tariffs take effect, while companies like Steve Madden are speeding up plans to move production out of China.

“Our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,” Walmart finance chief John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC.

TJX may have to raise prices, too. But the company said it will still be a bargain compared to rivals.

“The view from TJX is that regardless of tariffs they will still be able to maintain way more competitive prices than mainstream retailers,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in an email to CNN. “In other words, even if prices do generally rise because of tariffs, TJX will still be relatively cheaper.”"

From grill makers to beauty brands, companies of all kinds are firming up their plans for potentially higher tariffs under President-elect Donald Trump.

Expanding production in countries beyond China and passing on duties via higher prices are among the measures businesses are considering. Other companies are simply staying the course, content with their current sourcing mix.

Overall, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to mitigate expanded tariffs. Read on to see what measures five companies are taking to keep their supply chains steady during Trump's second term.

Traeger

Adding more manufacturing capacity in Vietnam is a priority for wood pellet grill maker Traeger as Trump targets China-made goods for tariff hikes. The company is in the process of bringing on a new production partner in Vietnam ""that has the ability to scale meaningfully,"" CEO Jeremy Andrus said on a Nov. 6 earnings call.

About 80% of Traeger's grills are manufactured in China, and 20% are made in Vietnam currently, Andrus said. Traeger's grill and cooking accessories are largely manufactured in China as well, except for its Taiwan-made ""Meater"" wireless meat thermometer. For now, wood pellet grills aren't covered by tariffs, but accessories are, according to Andrus.

""Pricing is always a lever."" Jeremy Andrus Traeger CEO

To whatever extent tariffs impact Traeger's sourcing locations, the company will work with manufacturers to improve efficiency and ""figure out how we can share in those tariffs,"" Andrus said. It could also lead Traeger to pass on added costs to customers.

""Pricing is always a lever, and I suspect that an environment where tariffs are broad-based and pervasive that most brands will also be leading to price to mitigate the downside of those tariffs, and we would look to do the same,"" Andrus said.

Additionally, Traeger is considering other manufacturing options in Asia.

Yeti

There are various unknowns regarding how potential tariffs under the Trump administration will take form, Yeti CFO Mike McMullen said on the company's Nov. 7 earnings call. That's why the cooler and drinkware company is focusing only on what it can control within its supply chain.

""We have been through this before in the 2018-2019 timeframe with soft [cooler] goods and we navigated that successfully,"" McMullen said. ""And we believe the plan that we have in place today would allow us to do that again.""

Changing prices is potentially an option to offset additional tariffs, McMullen said. The company is also pushing to expand its manufacturing footprint beyond China, launching production at its second drinkware facility outside the country in Q3.

""We remain confident that by the end of this year approximately 20% of our global drinkware capacity will be located outside of China and by the end of 2025, 50% of our drinkware capacity will be outside of China,"" President and CEO Matt Reintjes said on the call.

While many of Yeti's core products are made in China, it also relies on manufacturing in the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Poland, Mexico, Thailand and Malaysia, per its annual financial report.

Fortune Brands Innovations

Fortune Brands Innovations will continue to use a combination of primary and secondary sourcing options to manage tariff risks, CEO Nicholas Fink said on the home and security products maker's Nov. 6 earnings call.

""Your secondary source may cost you a bit more than your primary source, but if your primary source were to become more expensive because of tariffs, you can dial that down and dial up your secondary source and rebalance it to be the most efficient,"" Fink said.

That approach has led to a diverse production base for Fortune Brands. The company operated 16 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and 15 abroad at the end of last year, according to its annual financial report. Only two of those international manufacturing locations were in Asia.

With the variety of sourcing locations, less than 25% of Fortune's cost of goods sold is tied to China currently, EVP and CFO David Barry said on the call. That's down from more than 50% in 2018.

""We're operating under a base case scenario that tariffs from China at least are going to increase, and the team is working to optimize our network around that,"" Barry said. ""And we do view this as an opportunity.""

Crown Crafts

Not all businesses are paring back their reliance on China. Crown Crafts, an infant and toddler products company, is still firmly tied to the country even as tariff risks loom, CEO Olivia Elliott said on a Nov. 12 earnings call.

""China is still the better option."" Olivia Elliott CEO, Crown Crafts

As of March 31, Crown Crafts' largest concentration of contract manufacturers is in China, according to its annual financial report. It also maintains a foreign representative office in the country to coordinate production, purchases and shipments as well as pursue new vendors.

Maybe “Crown Crafts has considered tapping into manufacturers in other countries like Mexico, but China comes out ahead in terms of price and supply chain infrastructure, Elliott said.

""China is still the better option,"" Elliott said. ""That being said, we continue to look at other places and be ready just in case there are higher tariffs that we can't pass along and other countries become more viable.""

e.l.f. Beauty

When higher tariffs began impacting e.l.f. Beauty in 2019, it was much more reliant on China for sourcing, SVP and CFO Mandy Fields said on the makeup and skincare products company's Nov. 6 earnings call.

Back then, the company was much more exposed to China tariffs, with about 99% of its products being sourced from the country. Today, e.l.f. Beauty sources about 80% from China, Fields said.

Also working in the company's favor is its growing base of customers outside the U.S. Its international business drove 21% of its net sales in Q2, up from 16% one year ago. This will further reduce its exposure to the tariffs the country levies on China, Fields said.

""We certainly have run a number of scenarios for potential tariffs and I think still too early to tell what level those may come in,"" Fields said. ""But we have a playbook and we have a number of levers at our disposal."""

67,2024-11-14 00:00:00,From Production To Precision: How AI Is Reshaping Manufacturing,"AI making an impact on manufacturing getty

Manufacturing is getting a lot more attention in the news recently. While globalization has pushed the availability of goods around the world and lowered their cost in significant ways over these past many decades, the impact of globalization is also felt in regions where manufacturing was previously a mainstay of the local economy.

The use of AI is bringing a wide range of innovations to the manufacturing industry that not only improves the quality and availability of goods, but also the ability to bolster manufacturing efforts in regions where AI can augment otherwise high cost of labor or availability of materials.

AI is Improving and Augmenting the Manufacturing Process

For a long time automation has been used in the process of assembling and manufacturing products, especially since the Industrial Revolution and the Industry 2.0 and 3.0 waves that increasingly added factory lines, computer-driven automation, and more precision fabrication technologies. AI is adding to this automation formula by adding aspects of intelligence that makes these automated manufacturing processes more accurate and adaptable.

Even though most of today’s traditional industrial robots lack the basic intelligence to qualify as AI, AI-powered robots are poised to make a substantial impact in the manufacturing industry. You can have non-intelligent robots that are programmed to do specific tasks and automate it, and those robots are usually caged off from humans due to the damage they could cause if you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.

However, collaborative robots, also known as “cobots”, are a different sort of robotic beast. These AI-driven robots are being used for automating repetitive tasks, such as assembly or welding, or even materials handling. These collaborative robots are able to work side by side with humans, and so they don't need to be caged off.

The use of AI-powered computer vision solutions is also commonly applied to assist with quality control and inspection. Computer vision systems are being deployed to help spot defects in products throughout the manufacturing process. These systems can detect even the smallest of imperfections throughout the process, so that defective products can be removed from the production line and get fixed or scrapped before they get into customer's hands.

AI is helping move the manufacturing industry closer to the idea of the smart factory and the concept of Industry 4.0, in which machines, sensors, and systems are interconnected and communicate with each other. These interconnected systems collect data in real-time to optimize production processes, enhance decision-making, and enable predictive maintenance.

Furthermore, these fully automated and intelligent systems can be operated with minimal human intervention, allowing the idea of the “lights out factory” in which manufacturing systems can happen even while the lights are off.

In this vision, manufacturing systems operate around the clock, and you only need lights to be turned on when you're doing quality control. It's still more of a futuristic fantasy vision as it's very hard to take the human entirely out of the manufacturing loop, but you could see that technology is increasingly making its way in to automate those things.

AI is helping to make manufacturing processes more reliable, efficient, cost effective, and repeatable, giving factories more uptime, driving down the cost of goods, and reducing issues relating to labor shortages and staffing challenges. The smart factory can’t be realized without AI, since it takes intelligence to be smart.

AI is Keeping Manufacturing Running Efficiently and Effectively

Manufacturing companies are also using AI to keep the production line humming by keeping the equipment and tools running. AI analyzes data from sensors embedded in machinery to predict when equipment is likely to fail. This allows maintenance to be performed only when necessary, reducing equipment downtime and maintenance costs because if there's equipment downtime, the production line grinds to a halt.

AI is capable of analyzing all equipment data to know in advance when a machine might be heading towards failure. In anticipation of future potential failure, those machines may be able to be taken offline at a convenient time to perform predictive maintenance.

AI is also helping to keep manufacturing processes running by optimizing supply chain management by predicting demand, optimizing inventory levels, and improving logistics. Companies use AI to analyze vast amounts of data from suppliers, weather patterns, and market trends to enhance supply chain efficiency. With the help of AI, organizations are able to more effectively predict demand and optimize inventory levels, improve overall logistics as well.

Furthermore, AI is making manufacturing more efficient by optimizing production schedules by analyzing data, including order volumes, machine availability, and workforce capacity. This helps manufacturers maximize efficiency and minimize bottlenecks.

To keep energy-intensive production costs low, AI is even being used to monitor and optimize energy consumption in manufacturing facilities. AI systems analyze data from energy meters and production equipment to identify inefficiencies and suggest ways to reduce energy usage, leading to cost savings and more efficient and environmentally-friendly use of energy.

Assistance With Product Development and Design

AI is increasingly being used in the design process itself. Whether it's the design of a product or packaging, or improving overall product effectiveness, usability, reliability, or efficiency, AI is being used increasingly to accelerate the product design and prototyping. AI systems can analyze thousands of different alternatives and options, and identify desirable characteristics, factoring in cost, manufacturability, supply availability, energy usage, and other considerations.

These AI systems consider millions of different options with millions of different parameters and considerations, and help manufacturing firms design more efficiently, and more effectively deliver products to market.

As part of this process, organizations are employing AI to improve demand forecasting accuracy by analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and external factors such as economic indicators. This helps manufacturers better plan their production and inventory, reducing the risk of overproduction or stock-outs. These AI-powered forecasting systems can help anticipate demand and avoid supply chain or inventory disruptions that cause significant problems across the economy.

In all these ways, AI is making a significant impact on manufacturing today, and will no doubt power advancements in product design, development, production, and beyond in the manufacturing firm of the future."
68,NaN,What Trump could do on day one in the White House,"What Trump could do on day one in the White House

Bloomberg via Getty Images Donald Trump at his first inauguration in 2017

Donald Trump and his Republican Party have an ambitious agenda and control of US Congress. Trump has said he will ""make heads spin"" as he moves full-speed ahead after his inauguration on 20 January. His team has said to expect a flurry of executive orders - directives from the US president - out of the Oval Office in the first week. Policy experts and lawyers are already drafting those orders as part of the administration's transition. Still, advocacy groups and Democratic state governors have vowed to challenge at least some of those plans. Here is what the president-elect has said about his second-term priorities. Follow live: Trump transition updates

Immigration and the border

Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Sunday ""we know he promised to sign an executive order to secure the southern border"". ""We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,"" she said. In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early. He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his ""border tsar""; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term. Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists. Trump could also re-implement his ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed. President Joe Biden had called the programme ""inhumane"" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead. During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings. Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen. It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances. He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.

6 January

Trump did not mention pardons in his victory speech, but he has long suggested that pardoning those convicted of storming the Capitol in 2021 would be a priority. ""Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,"" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists. US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon. What's less clear is who might get a pardon. At one point, Trump told CNN: ""I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control."" Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide “on a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House”. More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.

Jack Smith

Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case. Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty. This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump. It remains unclear whether Trump and his supporters will still try to punish Mr Smith. Congressional Republicans have reportedly implied they intend to investigate his work. ""Jack Smith’s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished"", billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk posted on social media. Trump had said firing Jack Smith is one of his top priorities. ""I would fire him within two seconds. He’ll be one of the first things addressed,"" he said in an interview in October. Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a ""crooked person"", a ""scoundrel"" and other insults. Smith's cases were already facing an uncertain future. The Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have partial immunity from criminal prosecution for their conduct in office, undermining Mr Smith's work. Trump's electoral win also gives him the power to pardon himself of any federal crimes, though no president has done so before.

Paris climate agreement

In his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal. President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office. How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January. Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions. Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - ""We’re drilling, drilling, drilling,"" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year. Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.

Russia and Ukraine

On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine ""in a day"". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources. He has not yet given specifics on how he would negotiate the war's end beyond saying he would help the two countries strike a deal. Since his re-election, Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call that lasted ""about half an hour"", with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part. A source told the BBC that ""it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things"". The Kremlin denied that Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, though media reports said Trump warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.

Trade and economy

The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office. “We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,” Trump has said. “I will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.” He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to “use every tool and authority at their disposal” to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down. Trump’s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US. It’s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China. He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs. “I’m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don’t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I’m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,” he has said. These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval. Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security. Another promise is to “end the Biden-Harris war on American energy”, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers. Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration. The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market. Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.

Title X

Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country’s only national, federally-funded family planning programme. In 2019, during his first term, Trump’s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves. The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions. But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed. Now, it’s expected that Trump will change the rules again."

Dive Brief:

DHL Supply Chain is deploying a pair of artificial intelligence applications in partnership with consulting agency Boston Consulting Group, according to a press release last month.

The logistics services provider aims to enhance data management and analytics capabilities with the two generative AI applications to improve customer insight, better assess proposals and deliver more “tailored” solutions, per the release.

“Generative AI is transforming how we manage data and develop proposals,” DHL Supply Chain Global Chief Development Officer Markus Voss said in a statement. “By cleaning and assessing data from potential customers before designing logistics concepts, our engineers can be far more productive.”

Dive Insight:

DHL Supply Chain manages its GenAI use cases with a “product funnel approach” that includes a pilot period, CIO Mike Kreider told Supply Chain Dive.

The two use cases, referred to as “first Gen AI” and “second Gen AI,” are currently targeted for specific DHL Supply Chain user groups and “take an intentional product rollout approach,” Kreider said.

Two of the use cases in the “funnel” include a GenAI application for business development that enables a quicker analysis of customer requirements. By having GenAI handle the data, DHL Supply Chain’s business development team can create more personalized proposals, according to Kreider.

The second GenAI application use case sorts the available data so that DHL Supply Chain’s solutions designs team can offer better customer solutions, he added.

The AI tools can also help summarize customer queries and process legal documents, according to the press release.

“DHL leverages GenAI tools to transform key business processes and enhance our analytics capabilities to provide greater value to our customers and employees,” Kreider said. “These two GenAI solutions are doing just that and will be fully rolled out soon.”

Beyond introducing AI into its operations, DHL Supply Chain — which named a new CEO of North America earlier this year — has also been using automation and technology for labor retention and warehouse management."

Getty Images Unite said staff at North Air would walk out over the festive period and warned it could lead to ""widespread disruption"".

Fuel tanker drivers at Edinburgh Airport have announced a strike over the festive period as part of a pay dispute. The Unite union said staff at North Air would walk out for 19 days during Christmas and New Year after rejecting a 4.5% wage increase. North Air, which provides refuelling service for domestic and international airlines at Scotland's largest airport, said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision but that it remained open to talks. Unite accused it of ""refusing"" to re-enter negotiations and warned that some long haul flights could be disrupted by the planned stoppage, due to start on 18 December.

North Air is the only fuel supply company for some long haul flights which include United Airlines' service to New York and Emirates' to Dubai. LoganAir, which operates flights between Edinburgh and the Scottish islands, said it plans to operate a full and uninterrupted service throughout the festive period. Unite said North Air had to make an improved offer to combat several years of below inflation pay rises. In a ballot members overwhelmingly backed the strike action, which is scheduled to end on 6 January.

Travel disruption

Industrial officer Carrie Binnie warned that North Air was risking ""widespread travel disruption"" by failing to come to the table and resolve the dispute. She said: ""North Air has no concern for their workers or the travelling public. ""Unite has had no option but to confirm imminent industrial action. ""North Air now has very limited time to resolve this dispute. The company's belligerence is at serious risk of causing widespread travel disruption at Edinburgh airport over the festive season.""

Nearly 4,000 homes in the West of England are still without power following disruption caused by Storm Darragh. On Sunday more than 10,000 properties across the region were affected by power cuts as the storm swept across the UK, bringing strong winds and heavy rain throughout the country. Trees came down, travel was disrupted and events cancelled. Gusts hit more than 90 miles per hour (144km p/h) in areas around the mouth of the river Severn. Matt Turner, from National Grid, said while power has been restored to the majority of properties, its engineers are working as quickly as they can to help those remaining.

Residents at Edithmead Leisure Park Homes in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, have been without power since the early hours of Saturday. ""They [National Grid] told us that it'd be on by 6pm the next day. And then they updated that again to say 'no, it'll be 6pm on Sunday',"" said resident Barry Whitcombe. Mr Whitcombe added that local reports now suggest things may not return to normal until at least midday on Tuesday.

74,NaN,Irish Sea Border: Small businesses still being 'crucified',"Small businesses being 'crucified' by sea border

BBC Michael and Lesley Cairnduff said ""small businesses are being crucified""

The assembly will vote this week on whether Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, the Windsor Framework, should continue to operate for another four years. It effectively keeps NI inside the EU's single market for goods. That means that the goods trade across the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU country, has remained undisturbed by Brexit. The flipside is that goods arriving from elsewhere in the UK are subject to controls and checks—what is known as the Irish Sea border. Michael and Lesley Cairnduff, who run a County Down-based pet food business, said the paperwork needed was ""crucifying"" small business like theirs.

Border control post

At Larne Harbour the sea border continues to take physical form, with a new border control post under construction. Before Brexit, livestock arriving from other parts of the UK was checked here, but this new facility, built to EU specifications, is much bigger. Businesses have been dealing with new checks and their related bureaucracy since 2021, when the original version of the framework, the Northern Ireland Protocol, began to be implemented. For many larger firms, the impacts have now mostly been digested. They have, at a cost, hired the people and put the processes in place to ensure goods keep flowing from GB. The major UK supermarkets are all still in NI and some continue to expand. A chief executive of one large agrifood firm told the BBC that the sea border now rarely features in discussions within the business. However, for smaller firms with fewer resources the sea border remains an unpredictable challenge.

A new border control post is under construction at Larne Harbour

The BBC first spoke to Michael and Lesley Cairnduff at their pet food business in Newcastle, County Down, in 2021. At that time they had gone around four months without being able to get their supplies across from GB in the normal way, on a commercially shipped pallet. Their supplier adapted and the goods were able to flow again. ""We were lucky they were supportive,"" said Mr Cairnduff. ""They put all the necessary measures in place."" However, dealing with sea border issues still consumes a huge amount of time. ""We're just not getting the support from the system nor the politicians that was promised,"" he said. Ms Cairnduff added: ""Yesterday I spent two hours working on problems for a pallet coming in. I shouldn't have to do that. We should be spending our time helping customers, not doing paperwork for pallets.""

PA Media Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Windsor Framework made Northern Ireland ""the world's most exciting economic zone""

Supply chains

In the early days of the sea border's operation, there were some apocalyptic predictions of collapsing supply chains. That didn't happen, partially because the deal as originally agreed was never implemented. The EU eventually accepted that the arrangements for moving food and medicines were going to be unworkable and that NI would have to stay closer to some UK rules. If there was no sea border bust, then there has been no sea border boom either. The Windsor Framework means NI has unique dual market access: NI-based manufacturers have better access to the EU single market than firms based in GB, while also retaining full access to the UK market. It is this arrangement which led the former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to describe NI as having an ""unbelievably special position"" and being ""the world's most exciting economic zone"". The theory is that any international manufacturer that wants to serve both the UK and EU should set up in NI.

Businesses have been dealing with new checks and their related bureaucracy since 2021

However, the chief executive of NI's inward investment agency, Invest NI, says that hasn't happened yet. Speaking at Stormont in October, Kieran Donoghue said: ""There is still a relatively low level of awareness of the opportunities presented by dual market access. ""There will, in time, be foreign direct investment opportunities."" Stuart Anderson from the NI Chamber of Commerce said it was important to remember that the framework is protecting supply chains which cross the land border, particularly in the highly integrated agrifood sector. He points to the Department of Economy projections in 2019, which suggested a no-deal Brexit would mean ""a material and sustained disruption"" to those supply chains. ""Four years on, that's not where we are. The framework has brought the certainty and stability to allow that free flow of trade,"" he said. ""Some of our members who are exporting to the Republic and further into Europe are taking advantage.""

Last week a senior executive at one of NI's biggest manufacturing exporters told Newstalk radio that the Windsor Framework had helped protect access to EU markets. Robin Black, head of strategic development at Brett Martin, said it meant that ""in most regards nothing has changed for us as an exporter which is fantastic news, particularly with all our European markets"". However, Mr Anderson said that while surveys of his members suggest that most are now finding it manageable, a ""significant minority"" are saying the arrangements remain ""an acute challenge"".

In today's interconnected global economy, the landscape of supply chains is constantly evolving. From the pressures of the pandemic to the rise of digital technologies and the growing emphasis on sustainability, supply chain professionals are facing many challenges and opportunities.

I'm going to discuss these trends and expectations along with some concerns that are top of mind for executives, before introducing some of the next-generation solutions shaping the future of supply chain management.

State Of The Supply Chain

The disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic served as a wake-up call for many organizations, highlighting the vulnerabilities inherent in complex, global supply chains. This led to a notable shift toward reshoring and nearshoring production closer to consumer markets.

As companies reevaluate their reliance on distant suppliers and offshore manufacturing, this strategy aims to build more resilient supply chains capable of withstanding disruptions like natural disasters, geopolitical tensions and pandemics.

McKinsey & Company reports that 92% of surveyed companies have taken steps to improve supply chain resilience, with many relocating production closer to home to mitigate the impact of future disruptions similar to those experienced during the pandemic.

Digital transformation is another key focus area, with the adoption of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and data analytics accelerating rapidly.

As Accenture notes, leading companies are investing heavily in AI and advanced analytics to drive value in their supply chains, further driving competition to adopt and implement a digital transformation strategy. These technologies enhance visibility, efficiency and decision-making within supply chains, addressing the growing demand for end-to-end visibility and traceability driven by factors such as product recalls, food safety concerns and counterfeit goods.

Furthermore, sustainability and ethical sourcing are also in the spotlight, driven by consumer demand and regulatory pressure. Companies are now expected to reduce their carbon footprint, promote fair labor practices and ensure responsible sourcing of materials.

This shift toward sustainability is also closely tied to a revived focus on supplier relationship management as organizations strive to strengthen relationships with key suppliers to improve reliability, transparency and collaboration—often through closer integration and shared risk management initiatives.

Top Concerns Of Top Executives

Against this backdrop of change, top executives are grappling with a host of concerns related to supply chain management. Chief among these concerns is risk management, as organizations seek to ensure resilience against disruptions ranging from natural disasters to cyberattacks and supplier bankruptcies.

Hand in hand with managing risk are data security and supplier reliability concerns. Organizations must prioritize protecting sensitive information from cyber threats as digitalization continues to spread from end to end of the supply chain. With that interconnectedness, there is a focus on suppliers, too, to meet quality standards, adhere to regulatory requirements and fulfill contracted services.

Compliance with regulatory standards and labor laws is another overarching theme that touches on nearly every aspect of supply chain operations, along with building sustainability and ethical practices—all while managing costs effectively without compromising quality or reliability.

Next-Generation Supply Chain Solutions

To address this interconnected web of challenges, organizations are turning to next-generation supply chain solutions that leverage advanced technologies, enhance transparency and traceability and prioritize resilience planning and continuous improvement.

Organizations that invest in and adopt innovative technologies and new processes that integrate IoT/IIoT, blockchain, AI, ML and data analytics into everyday operations will gain an edge in the marketplace. By collecting real-time data on a vast number of variables, which can then be filtered and analyzed in digestible reports, those organizations will be able to make better-informed, data-driven business decisions.

Both McKinsey and Oracle report that the implementation of these technologies is helping companies achieve better performance by automating planning processes while improving demand forecasting, inventory management and order fulfillment. This results in significant efficiency gains and cost reductions, and companies enhance transparency, which builds trust among suppliers.

The emergence of tracking and traceability will be a transformative force in supply chains for those who can harness the power of it. Having visibility into every stage of the supply chain with barcode-level precision allows companies to trace the origin of materials, monitor production processes, ensure ethical sourcing practices, adjust routes quickly, track product viability in transit and more.

Comprehensive resilience planning and training will be a key differentiating factor for leading organizations. Developing contingencies based on historical data and future trends, and creating detailed scenario plans with viable alternate sourcing and routing strategies to train with, will help mitigate risks and maintain operations during disruptions. Companies that understand and identify the vulnerabilities and complexities they need to assess and prepare for will be in a much better position to weather the storm of the next pandemic-level crisis.

And finally, although perhaps not a solution in and of itself, a commitment to using all of these great sources of data and insight for continuous improvement throughout an organization will create a positive feedback loop that drives ongoing assessment, benchmarking and enhancement of processes to adapt to changing market dynamics and stakeholder expectations.

Mapping Your Own Evolution

When developing a map of which technologies and solutions are best suited for your business's needs, it’s important to think strategically about connected ecosystems and architecture solutions that will pair with your immediate needs, your short-term business plan and your long-term growth goals.

Supply chain management is a dynamic industry marked by challenges and opportunities. Organizations can set themselves up for success by putting into place the technologies and solutions that will provide the most detailed and up-to-date information available.

But by embracing a little bit of uncertainty (and then planning a contingency for it) as an opportunity for innovation, organizations can navigate this evolving landscape and build supply chains that are agile, transparent and sustainable in the face of that uncertainty.

Artificial intelligence and generative AI will impact nearly every industry and sector as organizations leverage their power to achieve unique goals. Gartner predicted that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will have deployed GenAI applications in production environments and/or used GenAI application programming interfaces or models. In 2023, that number was at less than 5%.

From enhancing productivity in the workplace to optimizing customer experiences, AI is becoming increasingly pervasive in the business and consumer landscape. However, like many technological advancements, the rise in AI adoption brings with it both positives and negatives and has introduced new threats and risks.

Challenges Facing Cybersecurity

Today, the barrier to entry into the world of cybercrime is unprecedently low, led in part by the broad accessibility of AI tools and services. Malicious actors use AI to improve, accelerate and scale cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Experienced and novice threat actors alike can use AI to accelerate the attack chain and conduct malicious cyber activity at scale.

While facing an increasingly challenging technological and threat landscape, IT and security leaders must also contend with the cybersecurity skills gap. Those responsible for protecting their organization’s sensitive data, critical infrastructure and digital assets are under extreme pressure.

Cybersecurity incidents can have devastating consequences, including physical damage, loss of data, monetary loss and erosion of customer trust. In a survey by my company, 87% of organizations said they experienced at least one security breach in 2023, partially attributed to a lack of cyber skills. More than half (53%) said they lost over $1 million in revenue, fines and other expenses. In some instances, corporate leaders are being held accountable for breaches; 51% of respondents said directors or executives experienced loss of employment, fines and even jail time following a cyberattack.

Combating Cyber Threats Through Collaboration

As the world becomes more networked and malicious actors increase in number and sophistication, advanced cybersecurity defense, mitigation, response and remediation strategies have become increasingly important. AI technology is introducing new risks, but defenders can also use AI to their advantage.

However, to effectively put customers first and help protect enterprises and government organizations from the complex cyber landscape, teamwork is essential. In addition to advanced cybersecurity solutions and private-sector collaboration, effectively fighting global cybercrime requires teamwork at scale and collaboration between the private and public sectors.

Teamwork Within Your Organization

Teamwork at scale includes cross-departmental approaches to cybersecurity. In practice, this involves integrating security into an organization's strategic planning, daily business operations and ongoing decision making.

Deploying security solutions that integrate seamlessly and do not disrupt employees’ workflow is also important. Moreover, prioritize organization-wide cybersecurity training and education. This can help employees understand that security is a shared responsibility and enable business and technology leaders to foster a cross-departmental approach to cybersecurity.

Industry-Wide Collaboration

At the same time, teamwork at scale must extend beyond the four walls of an organization. For example, organizations can explore strategic partnerships with cybersecurity industry leaders to deliver unique value and drive growth that helps secure our world.

Further, public/private sector partnerships and collaborative efforts between the cybersecurity industry, government, law enforcement, academia and nonprofit institutions are crucial to anticipating, detecting and combating global sophisticated cybercrime.

In practice, teamwork at scale requires information and knowledge sharing. Each organization—from public sector institutions to private sector businesses—sees the threat landscape from a different vantage point. Combining and sharing threat intelligence based on different perspectives helps reveal disruption points across cybercriminal activity, equipping law enforcement and other agencies to dismantle different parts of cybercriminals’ ecosystems and thwart their efforts.

Shared intelligence can also serve as an “early warning” system, empowering organizations in the public and private sectors to proactively safeguard against new vulnerabilities and threats.

Public And Private Partnerships In Action

Collaborative public and private sector partnerships can take numerous forms and help secure organizations in the increasingly complex and sophisticated world of cyber threats. For example, the International Criminal Police Organization's ""Project Gateway,"" of which my company is a member, facilitates the exchange of cyber information to support law enforcement. This ongoing collaboration has enhanced threat intelligence standards and protocols across the industry, contributing to several cybercriminal takedowns. In addition to preventing cybercrime, increasingly holding cybercriminals accountable is key to deterrence.

Another example is the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which introduced its Secure by Design Pledge. More than 200 companies, my own included, have signed the pledge at the time of this writing. It was created to encourage industry stakeholders—including technology companies, software developers and cybersecurity professionals—to prioritize cybersecurity throughout the product development lifecycle and to follow best practices. CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge helps strengthen cyber resiliency by building on existing software security best practices and encouraging and guiding technology vendors to make product development processes and the resulting technologies more secure.

Creating A Resilient Digital Ecosystem

The rise in AI adoption and AI-augmented attacks have created an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. The stakes are higher than ever, and collaborative public and private sector initiatives can help advance cybersecurity to protect society at large. Joint efforts, teamwork at scale and leveraging the benefits of AI all play a key role in creating a resilient and trustworthy digital ecosystem.

77,NaN,Translink apology for bus disruption amid Belfast congestion,"Translink apology for bus disruption caused by city congestion

BBC Translink has been criticised for announcing updates on some routes, after the service was due

The head of transport company Translink has apologised to passengers affected by recent disruption to some bus services caused by traffic congestion in Belfast. Chris Conway said the company was doing all it could to lessen the impact, after weeks of heavy traffic in the city centre at peak times. His comments came after Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd said he would give more money to subsidise Translink, if he could. O'Dowd said that ""there have been delays to Translink services but the vast majority are running"" and he has suggested that commuters should get out of the car and use public transport.

The SDLP's Matthew O'Toole, who scheduled an urgent question in the assembly about the traffic, said Northern Ireland's bus network was such ""a disaster"" it is preventing people from leaving their car at home and reducing traffic in Belfast city centre. Translink said that more than 400,000 additional journeys have been made on buses and trains in the last two months - compared to the same time last year. The company said that was down to an increase in services, including new hourly Enterprise trains to Dublin.

PA Media Translink said that more than 400,000 additional journeys have been made on buses and trains in the last two months

Translink Chief Executive Chris Conway told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme: ""We have issues with congestion and our bus network is caught up in that as well. ""We're certainly not happy with that and, certainly, I would apologise to our passengers for any impact that has on them. ""What we are trying to do is to just manage that as best we can. ""We will try and help passengers on to the next service, on to an alternative service, or we will move stop stops try and improve punctuality and reliability."" He also said that Belfast's ""low car parking charges are attracting people in to the city"", adding that ""a lot of that parking is on-street parking which ""could be freed up for better road space for vehicles"". Mr Conway also called for a review into Belfast's bus lanes as he said they were ""designed in Belfast was back in 2012"".

Earlier, O'Toole, who leads the opposition at Stormont, told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that Northern Ireland's public transport network has suffered ""generational under-investment... for a long time"". He added that the bus network has failed people ""over a long time"", citing that information given on bus stop screens and online is often ""completely wrong"". His comments came as The Nolan Show investigated the running of a number of services and found that Translink were announcing information updates on some routes after the service was due. Translink said they operate about 63,000 bus services but can run into ""a small percentage of cancellations"". A spokesperson said: ""These can be for many reasons including heavy traffic, road traffic accidents, weather conditions and mechanical issues. ""We advise passengers to plan ahead and leave extra time for their journey during the busy pre-Christmas period and check Translink's social media channels, Journey Planner and Contact Centre.""

Responding later on Tuesday, O'Dowd told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback show: ""Thousands of people use Translink services in Belfast and the greater Belfast area, thousands of people use Translink services to get in and out if Belfast every day but it is hugely regrettable when a service is cancelled."" O'Dowd added there is no quick fix solution to the current challenges faced by commuters to Belfast, but reiterated that ""if you are going into Belfast in a private car, you should expect congestion"".

'Worst subsidised regions'

Meanwhile the chair of Stormont's infrastructure committee said public transport in Northern Ireland is too expensive to encourage people to leave the car at home. DUP assembly member Deborah Erskine told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, that the Department of Infrastructure needs to do more to ease congestion in Belfast city centre, after an official said people should work from home one day a week to help with traffic problems. Ms Erskine said people cannot be expected to make these lifestyle changes with the current public transport system. ""We are one of the worst subsidised regions in the whole of the UK as well in relation to our public transport. So if we're telling people to get out of their car, get on to public transport, we have to expand that network and we have to make it a fair and equitable choice for people.""

Roger Pollen, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""The department operates the roads and the buses, and there is a real potential for a conflict of interest there. ""So, they have actually reduced the capacity on the roads for cars to the advantage of the bus service that they own and operate, and I think they have done it in a fairly chaotic way."" He suggested that park and rides could be made free to the end of January because traders are ""really struggling""."

79,2024-12-09 00:00:00,Leading Through Disruption: Why 2025 Will Demand A New Playbook For Change,"By Feon Ang, Vice President, LinkedIn Talent Solutions and Managing Director, APAC

LinkedIn

As I reflect on 2024 and look ahead to the new year, one thing is clear: we're in the midst of significant change, redefining how we work and collaborate. Leading LinkedIn Asia-Pacific (APAC) offers a unique vantage point to understand the challenges and opportunities shaping the workforce of tomorrow. LinkedIn is a platform with more than 1 billion members—323 million in APAC—and 69 million companies, where 7 people are hired and nearly 18,000 connections are made every minute. We see firsthand how the rapid evolution of generative AI, the refinement of hybrid work models, and shifting job requirements are redefining the way we work. For business leaders, myself included, navigating these changes while fostering engagement and productivity has never been more complex—or more important.

Our data shows that by 2030, the skills required for the same job will have shifted by 70%, accelerated by generative AI. What I find particularly striking is a disconnect: while 67% of APAC professionals feel overwhelmed by workplace changes, only 39% trust their managers to guide them effectively. Moreover, 77% of workers in the region are actively seeking leadership guidance to help them adapt.

This leadership gap highlights what I believe will be the defining challenge for 2025: business leaders must evolve into experts in change management. Traditional management approaches no longer suffice in a world where AI is reshaping industries, roles and expectations. Success in this new era of work requires a sophisticated blend of technological understanding and human-centric leadership.

LinkedIn

The Human Element Of Technology-Driven Change

Our research shows that AI adoption will remain the dominant organizational priority in 2025, with more than half (58%) of global executives focusing on implementing new AI technologies. However, the key to successful transformation extends beyond technical implementation.

Across APAC, leaders must prioritize the human dimension of change management—building trust, fostering open dialogue, and cultivating cultures of adaptability and collaboration. These elements are crucial for helping teams embrace AI-driven workflows and adopt the growth mindset required for continuous reskilling in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Soft skills are becoming indispensable as AI assumes more routine tasks; over 60% of professionals globally recognize their growing importance. What we cannot overlook is the importance of these skills among leaders. We have seen a 31% increase in S&P 500 and unicorn company executives adding soft skills to their LinkedIn profiles since 2018, a clear signal of their growing importance for modern leadership.

Business leaders set the tone from the top, so when they model soft skills such as adaptability and empathy, they help to foster a culture of resilience and collaboration that can impact the entire organization. Other skills, such as storytelling and emotional intelligence, are just as vital for aligning teams around a shared vision and guiding them through periods of disruption.

Reimagining Leadership Communication

The post-pandemic era has ushered in new approaches to change management. LinkedIn’s data reveals that eight in 10 global executives are actively evolving their leadership styles, with communication emerging as a critical focus area.

One notable trend is the rise of authentic, informal leadership communication. CEOs are increasingly using short-form video content on LinkedIn to share real-time company updates. These direct, personal messages allow teams to connect with leaders, building trust through transparency and accessibility.

Our data underscores the effectiveness of this approach: CEO posts on LinkedIn have increased by 23% globally year-over-year, with video posts surging by 40% in the same period. Once considered too informal for the professional sphere, these casual “selfie-style” video updates are set to become a staple of C-suite communication in 2025. Leaders who embrace this style can build trust with their teams, creating a sense of connection and alignment that is critical during times of uncertainty.

LinkedIn

Activating Change Management Partners

With 70% of global executives acknowledging accelerating workplace change, Chief Human Resources Officers (CHROs) and talent leaders are also becoming invaluable strategic partners. Their expertise in employee engagement and organizational development is crucial for navigating this evolving landscape.

Equally important are team managers, who bridge the gap between leadership vision and employee experience. When equipped with strong emotional intelligence and communication skills, managers can better guide their teams through transformation, translating organizational changes into personal, actionable goals for individuals. This approach not only drives operational alignment but also empowers teams to adapt and excel.

Building Learning-Centric Organizations

The pace of change demands a shift toward continuous learning. This makes building adaptability and creativity crucial for effective human-AI collaboration and informed, thoughtful decision-making.

Encouragingly, our data reveals an interesting correlation: employees who acquire generative AI skills are five times more likely to develop capabilities like creativity and design thinking. In Southeast Asia, they’re seven times more likely to develop emotional intelligence.

This “skill development momentum” underscores the opportunity AI adoption presents to catalyze broader professional growth. However, realizing this potential requires embedding continuous learning into an organization’s DNA. From entry-level hires to senior executives, learning how to learn must become a core organizational capability.

Companies that invest in skill-building programs that marry technical proficiency with soft skills development will be better placed to cultivate adaptable, future-ready talent. This approach not only enhances organizational resilience, but also drives engagement and retention.

As we look toward 2025 and beyond, the challenges also present unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation. Organizations that prioritize skills building and talent development will have a distinct advantage. While AI and other technologies are reshaping the workplace, soft skills—communication, emotional intelligence and adaptability—remain the cornerstone of effective change management, and will define the leaders who thrive in this era.

80,2024-12-09 00:00:00,Sustainability To Resilience: Adapt ESG Strategies In A Changing World,"ESG in a changing world getty

The impending return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House paired with conservative majorities in the House, Senate and Supreme Court leaves the future of many aspects of ESG progress in limbo. Is ESG officially dead or merely in transition? Is it possible to balance innovation and the pursuit of economic growth with protecting the planet?

Building on these topline questions, there are many issues to consider. Did this drive toward reporting and transparency help or hurt the pursuit of more sustainable, responsible and resilient business practices? How can an holistic approach be designed to incorporate broader aspects of material risk to ensure the resilience and sustainability of business operations?

Below are some concrete takeaways to consider.

Engage with multiple ESG stakeholders beyond peers

In order to right size a program in this new environment, understanding and focusing the ESG scope of your organization is critical. That means engaging a broad variety of stakeholders in dialogue about the most material issues. Boards need to be updated on key risks and use that information to govern stakeholder engagement plans. They may also consider meeting periodically with relevant external stakeholders in addition to more common engagements like employee site visits to grow their understanding of issues and risks.

Increasing engagement with stakeholders, particularly representatives from environmental non-profit organizations, may provide valuable insights on climate and nature-related risks or the sentiment of affected community groups. Investing in adaptation initiatives is also crucial, especially for businesses that heavily rely on physical assets, as it serves as a vital risk mitigation strategy. Even if the impacts of climate change are not currently material to the organization, it is advisable to leverage the risk management or business continuity team to monitor emerging global issues, such as climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, technological disruptions from emerging advanced technology, and geopolitical conflicts. Regular updates on these developments are essential for business leaders to stay informed and prepared.

It is also critical to engage with voices expressing reservations to ESG initiatives as there is a viable counterargument to be made. Some of the backlash to ESG is understandable given the weaknesses exposed by ongoing sustainability shortfalls and tradeoffs. SpaceX pulls off a major rocket launch (and return) but with troubling environmental implications—how can conflicting priorities be balanced? Coca-Cola faces additional greenwashing lawsuits—and they are hardly the only major company to be accused of greenwashing or cherry-picking data to hide or highlight. Tesla leads the EV transition but their batteries raise mining challenges—everywhere you look, concerns about sustainability are rising. When these stakeholders have been listened to, it is easier to comprehend their concerns, adjust as necessary and also more effectively plan for the risk of political backlash.

Expand risk assessment to include disruption from growing geopolitical risks

Once stakeholders have been engaged, the information needs to be analyzed and explored for risk prioritization. For example, both domestic political and geopolitical risk are majorly impacting businesses in ways that they are not always prepared to handle. To dig into these issues, I reached out to Frederik Otto, Director Advisory Services at AccountAbility and Senior Fellow at The Sustainability Board, to learn from his insights on the importance of resilience from a business standpoint, especially at this difficult transition point.

Consider that geopolitical risk is increasing worldwide and risk assessments must evolve to include them even if they seem outside of the normal scope of what would be considered. Traditional assessments may gloss over certain facets of political instability or international trade tensions focusing more traditionally on sectoral, internal or regulatory issues. But this scope can be too narrow in an interconnected world that is increasingly fragmenting. Consider the impact of the Russia-Ukraine War on sustainability strategies across Europe or the Houthi attacks on container ships in the Red Sea. Frederik Otto notes that “the impacts of these events have caused significant supply chain disruptions which amplified protectionism as well as near- and friendshoring” and while this may de-risk supply chains, it creates new volatilities like inflation due to price increases of goods and services.

By widening the board’s risk aperture, leaders can gain a more comprehensive understanding of potential impacts on investments and operations. This broader evaluation criteria is essential for anticipating and mitigating risks that could disrupt business continuity and resilience.

Importantly, the risk assessment must not stop at the organization’s edge but include the full lifecycle of key products or services, including suppliers. Geopolitical instability can significantly affect value chains and could jeopardize the viability of key suppliers, many of which are small and mid-sized enterprises in emerging markets, which may have invested less in their resilience. It’s vital to ensure that business operations, whether in urban centers or rural areas, are resilient to major disruptions.

For example, supply chains in politically unstable regions might face interruptions that could jeopardize the financial stability of the entire value chain. Otto explains how “polycrises do not just affect emerging markets, but even developed countries in new and sometimes unexpected ways” such as crime spikes during heatwaves. The data bears this out, as in a 2023 study from John Jay College of Criminal Justice that mentions temperature volatility is significantly associated with the incidence of violence. Upward departures in temperature are associated with increases in robbery and homicide, while downward departures are associated in the opposite direction. Proactively addressing these risks through strategic planning and diversification can help mitigate the worst impacts and secure value chains against risks such as geopolitical and conflict threats.

Accelerate the shift towards sustainable investing despite current ESG challenges

It’s not just companies that need to think through these challenges, but they also need to educate and inform their investors. Current geopolitical situations, marked by unprecedented challenges, reshape how investors assess risks and opportunities. Sustainability and the fight against climate change are reframed as a means of achieving immediate security goals, rather than just a long-term environmental objective. This kind of reframing of the goals can be helpful in designing a future-proofed ESG program for our current times.

The polycrisis has accelerated the shift towards sustainable investing, with global sustainable assets projected to exceed $53 trillion by 2025 and an annual investment of $6.9 trillion needed by 2030 to ensure infrastructure investment is on track to meet the world’s climate goals. While Europe accounts for most of these ESG assets, the US is on track for high growth since 2022.

In this new economic paradigm, where ecological considerations are intrinsically linked to security, the companies aligned with the ecological transition and strategic autonomy may gain easier access to capital. Lenders are increasingly incorporating sustainability criteria into their lending decisions, reflecting regulatory pressure, changing market dynamics and the growing realization that these impacts are financially material especially to manufacturers. This is why a forward-thinking approach is essential and highlights the importance of looking beyond short-term considerations.

Address insurance market challenges

Investors aren’t the only financial stakeholders who need to be engaged – insurers play a key role as well. A comprehensive approach to risk management strengthens organizational resilience against both human-induced and natural threats. Just as wars may impact business strategy and continuity, the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related events, such as floods, rising sea levels, and wildfires, have rendered many areas uninsurable, as we are seeing during this active hurricane season in Florida. Businesses must reassess their risk mitigation and investment strategies considering these developments given that some areas may soon be uninhabitable or subject to managed retreat.

Long-term scenario planning and strategic data modeling becomes indispensable here, allowing businesses to test and refine adaptation plans for various climate-related scenarios so that they can make proactive decisions. This includes evaluating the long-term viability of protecting and insuring assets located in high-risk areas and exploring alternative risk transfer mechanisms to include appropriate insurance coverage, indemnification in contracts, reciprocal agreements within industry, or risk shifting via credit derivatives.

In conclusion, while the ESG acronym is likely on its deathbed, the underlying concepts and questions still pose material risks for organizations that they need to address. Business leaders must adopt a holistic approach to integrating risk and sustainability to build greater organizational resilience in an uncertain and complex operating environment. By doing so, they can ensure that their businesses are prepared for a wide range of potential disruptions including in the face of the growing ESG backlash. Through strategic planning and robust risk mitigation as well as reframing and focusing sustainability strategies around financial material and security concerns, leaders can navigate the complexities of today's global landscape and secure long-term success.

82,NaN,Chelsea to minimise disruption of Kazakhstan trip,"Chelsea have made a host of special arrangements to handle the more than 6,000km trip to Kazakhstan on Thursday.

The Conference League draw gave Chelsea an away trip to Astana, which has served as a significant logistical challenge for the club to organise.

Astana is the capital in central Kazakhstan but the match will be played in Almaty, 1,200 km away, in the south of the country, amid renovations to the club's home stadium.

Chelsea have been given dispensation from Uefa to hold an early press conference and training session in Surrey, instead of the usual pre-match preview events typically hosted in the home country, to help manage their travel plans.

They will then travel to Almaty by a direct charterer eight-hour flight - as is often the case for matches away in Europe - while avoiding a direct flight path over Russia, Ukraine and the Middle East, amid multiple ongoing conflicts.

When in Kazakhstan, Chelsea's players will avoid adapting to the Kazakhstan time zone, which is five hours ahead of the UK, effectively meaning they will treat the 8.30pm local kick-off as a 3.30pm kick-off time.

Manager Enzo Maresca also gave his squad the day off on Monday and will likely ring the changes again after the 4-2 win at Tottenham on Sunday.

The Italian has made between seven and 11 changes for almost every match week of the season as he uses his extensive squad.

In addition, several academy players will potentially get an opportunity for a match played in freezing temperatures between -6 and -11 degrees on Thursday.

Cole Palmer is among the players not selected to play in the competition but could be among the additions in February for the knockout rounds.

Canada Post workers have been on strike since Nov. 15, shutting down the government-owned carrier's operations throughout the country.

The work stoppage comes after Canada Post failed to reach new contract agreements with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents more than 55,000 of the carrier's employees. The union is calling for pay raises, safer working conditions and an expansion of public postal services.

As negotiations continue, shippers with last-mile delivery needs in Canada are diverting volume to other carriers as they try to keep up with the peak holiday ordering rush. But this response is straining many delivery providers' networks during an already busy period.

Here's what parcel shippers should know about the Canada Post strike, including its impact on shipping times and capacity at other carriers.

How long will the Canada Post strike last?

The strike's duration depends on how soon Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers can resolve their differences and reach an agreement.

The parties have exchanged a series of counterproposals on their next labor deal since discussions reignited last week. Jan Simpson, national president of the union, said in a Dec. 4 update that its proposals feature movement on both union and employer demands.

""We all want CUPW members to get back on the job with their rights protected, health and safety issues resolved, wages that reflect inflation, and security for the future in new collective agreements,"" Simpson said.

On Saturday, Canada Post said it has ""made significant moves to close the gap on key issues like weekend delivery, pensions and wages and bring much-needed urgency to the discussions."" However, the Toronto Star reported the next day that the union expressed frustration over the carrier’s latest proposal.

""Based on the union's response, what they've put out to the public, they're still far from seeing eye to eye on these proposals,"" Alison Layfield, director of product development at ePost Global, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.

Whenever the strike ends, its impact will continue to linger. When Canada Post service resumes, delays are likely as the carrier delivers stored volume ""on a first-in, first-out basis,"" according to its website.

Maggie Barnett, CEO of LVK Logistics, a fulfillment provider in Canada and the U.S., expects it will take up to 10 days once the strike ends for Canada Post's operations to normalize.

""Everyone's going to come out of the gate sluggish, and there's going to be a lot to do, because there's things just sitting in the system,"" Barnett said.

How disruptive has the strike been for deliveries?

Delays are mounting throughout the Canada parcel industry due to the strike.

On-time delivery performance in Canada has dropped by 14% since the week of Oct. 28, according to a Dec. 3 report from project44. The company considers a package to be on time if it reaches its destination by the original estimated delivery date.

The steep drop is due in part to Canada Post's major presence in the country's parcel market and limited variety in shippers' carrier rosters, according to project44. While project44 shippers use around six last-mile carriers on average, that falls to less than three for inbound and outbound Canada shipments.

""Because of this lack of carrier diversity, when an event like the postal strike occurs, the Canadian market becomes highly vulnerable to disruptions,"" project44 said. ""Shippers are now scrambling to find capacity and must make tough decisions between cost and delivery time.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimated that the strike would cost small- and medium-sized companies more than $1 billion by Dec. 4, as they grapple with more expensive delivery alternatives and lost orders. One example the federation mentioned was a seed supplier in Prince Edward Island that can't deliver its catalogs during the work stoppage.

""Rather than looking forward to increased revenue, it’s now facing substantial storage fees for the large volume of printed materials and says orders for Christmas will be low,"" the group said.

Can other carriers pick up the slack?

With packages in the Canada Post network at a standstill, many shippers are scrambling to find alternative delivery options. But securing enough capacity with another carrier is a tall order during the holidays, Barnett said.

""That's creating further delays, because the folks who are taking that Canada Post volume are unable to absorb that volume during peak season,"" she said.

Carriers are deploying different strategies to manage the volume influx. This is evident in how UPS and Canada parcel carrier Purolator each handled shipments from eShipper, which connects e-commerce businesses with delivery providers.

UPS froze shipments from eShipper for 48 hours, while Purolator is looking to limit the number of packages it picks up from the company, Imtiaz Kermali, eShipper VP of sales and marketing, said during a Thursday webinar.

""We're going to get to the normality a lot faster if we help these carriers think through what their strategy is right now, which is, let's get rid of these clogs, add more capacity and try and come back even stronger over the next two weeks,"" Kermali said.

UPS did not respond to a request for comment. Purolator is temporarily pausing service to select shipping partners as it navigates ""a significant increase in volume,"" the company told Supply Chain Dive on Thursday.

""This was necessary to maintain the integrity of our network, ensure the health and safety of our employees and allow us to prioritize critical shipments,"" Purolator said in an email. ""We are assessing the condition of our network hourly and will make all attempts to remove the service suspension as soon as possible.""

Other carriers are also adjusting in the wake of the strike. On Nov. 29, the U.S. Postal Service suspended its acceptance of international mail to Canada. FedEx has instituted ""a temporary limit of five packages per drop-off"" at its retail locations to manage higher demand, a company spokesperson told CBC News on Friday.

How can shippers limit disruptions from the strike?

Securing access to carriers that suit your particular shipping needs goes a long way, experts say.

For example, shippers with packages moving from the U.S. into Canada should make sure they're using a ""door-to-door"" service that doesn't rely on Canada Post for any portion of the delivery process, Barnett said.

Companies also have to consider what areas of Canada they deliver to. While a handful of major carriers can cover around 80% to 90% of the country, that service typically comes with a residential delivery surcharge, Kermali said. Smaller, regional carriers tend not to have this added fee, but they also are limited in coverage outside major cities.

""They do not criss-cross across the country, connecting those regions unless they have an outside partner that could be an airline or a ground partner who will move product from, let's say, Toronto to Vancouver, and then they'll deliver in Vancouver,"" Kermali added.

Beyond carrier adjustments, companies should also consider how to keep customers happy during the strike, Jen Seran, former director of business operations at e-commerce shipping provider Stallion Express, wrote in a LinkedIn post. This includes providing clear and transparent communication about potential delays, leveraging physical store locations for pickups and offering discounted or free shipping.

""While the current disruptions pose challenges, they also offer a chance to get creative with your logistics,"" Seran said."

BBC Several roofs were blown off buildings across the West Country, including this one in Bath

Storm Darragh is continuing to cause disruption to trains, roads and properties in the West Country. Great Western Railway (GWR) said no trains were running through Westbury or Chippenham. On Saturday, both stations sustained structural damage in strong winds. There are more than 10,000 properties across the region without power, but engineers from the National Grid and Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) are working to restore the supply. A yellow Met Office weather warning remains in place for England and Wales until Sunday evening with gusts of 35-45mph expected inland and 70mph in coastal areas.

The M48 Severn Bridge remain closed due to strong winds, but the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge and Clifton Suspension Bridge have been reopened.

According to the National Grid, 9,290 properties in Bristol, Somerset and Gloucestershire are without power. SSE, which supplies electricity to Wiltshire, said 721 properties in the county have no power. Matt Turner from the National Grid said restoring power this weekend has been a ""mammoth task"" for engineers. ""Engineers have dealt with hundreds of incidents over the last 48 hours, often in atrocious conditions, and so far power has been restored to 1.4 million customers across our all regions, including the South West. ""We apologise for the ongoing frustration being experienced. ""Repairs to faults on our network will continue tonight and throughout tomorrow as our teams work as quickly as they can to restore power,"" he said. An SSE spokesperson said there are around 6,500 homes and business in England who remain off supply. ""[Our] enlarged team is making considerable progress in what have been very challenging conditions,"" they said. ""In some areas, the winds were too high for working at height to go ahead safely.""

'Significant disruption'

On Saturday, GWR warned customers that there would be a knock-on effect into Sunday following problems on the train network. There are no services between Bath Spa and Salisbury due to debris on the track at Westbury. Bath Christmas Market is open again, but the train operator has advised passengers to seek other methods of transport if attending. With delays around the area and the volume of people attending the festive attraction, the operator has warned that Bath Spa station may close to avoid overcrowding. Customers who have purchased train tickets for Sunday are able to use their tickets on Monday. Those who choose not to travel can claim a full refund on their ticket."

An amber weather warning was put in place across the Isle of Man for gusts of up to 80mph (129km/h) until midnight, with the south and south-west coast most at risk. People were urged to only drive if essential as the infrastructure department dealt with more than 50 fallen trees, some of which brought power lines down.

Simon Harnaman from Redland, Bristol, was awoken just before 05:00 by his son to say his car alarm was going off. ""I rushed to the front of the house, opened the blinds and saw that there was a rather large tree resting on top of my car. ""It's as big as our house - it must be about 60ft. ""It just came right over the top of it, so I now have a rather poorly Volvo,"" he said. Within an hour-and-a-half of reporting it, the council had deployed staff with chainsaws and shredders to remove the tree.

Power outages

It has also been a long wait for people who have been left without electricity across the region due to power cuts. People in Haselbury Plucknett near Crewkerne, Somerset, have been without power for most of the afternoon. Resident Barbara said she has been listening to the radio on her wind-up radio since midday. ""It was supposed to be the big church clean before Christmas, but I hadn't got the message,"" she said. ""I turned up and did a couple of hours of cleaning in the church until the power went out there. ""I then came home and had power for about an hour, quickly made a hot meal, a hot drink and topped up my thermal flask,"" she said.

'Batteries and candles'

Hilary from Street in Somerset said her home ran out of power whilst she was making her ""Christmas gravy"". ""We went to the shop and got batteries and candles,"" she said. ""We were going to have a roast, but instead we're now having ham and cheese and some Bailey's. ""If we still don't have power we'll just wrap presents later.

108,NaN,Train delays after UK rail network hit by nationwide fault,"Nationwide fault causes delays across rail network

PA Media

A ""nationwide fault"" has caused major disruption across at least 10 lines of the UK's rail network, National Rail says. National Rail blamed the issue on the radio system used between train drivers and signallers. The issue has now been fixed, but residual delays may continue while the timetable is restored. Services in and out of England's major transport hubs, including Manchester Piccadilly, London Paddington and Southampton Central, were affected.

Great Northern, Northern, ScotRail, Southeastern, Southern, South Western Railway, Thameslink, Gatwick Express, Heathrow Express and the Elizabeth line were all impacted. Travel expert Simon Calder told BBC Radio 5Live that Friday morning had been ""a miserable rush hour for a lot of people"". National Rail said the issue appears to be a fault with the onboard GSMR radio system, which is used to communicate in case of emergencies. The BBC understands the cause of the fault has been located and has been fixed. To ease disruption prior to this, a back-up system was being used instead. Network Rail said the issue was mainly affecting trains at the start or end of the day, which a spokesperson said was ""causing a few minutes of delay at the start of the day"". But ""once up-and-running the system is working normally and the impact on passengers is minimal,"" it added. Even though the problem has now been fixed, National Rail said there may be some residual disruption while timetables are restored. It advises that passengers may be entitled to compensation if their journey is delayed.

'Third consecutive day' of delays

Matthew Smith Matthew Smith said his journey to work this morning was ""pandemonium""

One passenger told the BBC he ended up paying for a £54 taxi ride to finish his journey. Matthew Smith, 47, was travelling from Portsmouth to Basingstoke on Friday morning for work. The train he intended on getting was no longer stopping at Basingstoke so he was advised to catch the next one, half an hour later. ""Staff at the station had as much information as I could obtain from the app,"" he said. Mr Smith eventually caught a train to Havant before deciding to finish his journey in a taxi. ""This is the third consecutive day where there have been issues on these trains and it is not pleasurable or acceptable especially given the price we pay for rail journeys,"" he said. At London Waterloo, some commuters said they would be at least an hour late to work because of the disruption. One woman said she was running three hours late for a job interview. BBC producer Carolyn Rice was on board a train from Southampton bound for Waterloo, but it ended up terminating at Woking an hour behind schedule. That was on top of disruption caused by over-running engineering works.

Across the network on Friday morning, most delays appeared to be no longer than 15 minutes, but some services were delayed by up to an hour. Earlier in the day, National Rail said travellers should plan for some services to be cancelled at short notice. ScotRail said its services were affected on Friday morning but have since returned to normal operation. The Gatwick Express was only running between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport, and some Heathrow Express trains were delayed. Services along the entire Elizabeth line were also affected. Elsewhere, journeys between Brighton and Southampton Central, and Kings Lynn and London Kings Cross, were not running the entire length of the line.

In 2025, disruption is not just a possibility—it’s a certainty. A survey of corporate board directors revealed that 62% view managing disruption as more crucial than ever. Yet only 19% feel confident their management teams are prepared to handle it. In his recently published book Disrupt with Impact: Achieve Business Success in an Unpredictable World, Roger Spitz highlights that traditional strategies are no longer sufficient for addressing complex challenges.

The space industry offers a model for boards preparing for 2025, demonstrating how pioneering approaches in AI and cybersecurity drive resilience and innovation in high-stakes environments. From autonomous, AI-powered spacecraft to sophisticated cybersecurity measures protecting critical assets, space organizations showcase how technology can become a strategic advantage.

Integrating responsible AI practices and fortifying cybersecurity frameworks will be key for boardrooms focused on the future. By drawing inspiration from the space sector and industry best practices, boards can turn disruption into a pathway for growth, guiding their organizations toward resilience and success in the coming year.

AI: The Celestial Catalyst For Boardrooms

AI is set to redefine how organizations operate, especially in data-driven environments like space exploration. Space agencies depend on AI to drive faster, more accurate decisions, manage autonomous spacecraft, analyze vast datasets and adapt to unpredictable conditions—all critical for high-stakes missions. The space sector’s use of AI is a testament to its potential to revolutionize industries, offering a model for how organizations can leverage AI to enhance operations and inform strategy.

Despite AI’s potential, many boards remain hesitant. According to a Deloitte study, nearly 50% of boardrooms haven’t prioritized AI, even though its influence on business strategy is undeniable. Effective AI governance demands proactive board engagement, strategic foresight and ethical awareness. Boards must emphasize AI, integrating it into discussions on risk, opportunity and organizational ambition.

To effectively guide AI adoption, boards must start by prioritizing AI strategically. By placing AI as a recurring agenda item, boards can focus on its role in advancing organizational resilience and growth, ensuring regular discussions on goals, risks and emerging opportunities. Periodic sessions or retreats dedicated to AI can also help keep leadership aligned with the rapidly evolving landscape.

Defining a clear risk appetite is crucial as boards balance the innovative potential of AI with its inherent risks. Through scenario planning, boards can explore AI’s transformative possibilities while anticipating challenges, helping align AI initiatives with organizational values and market demands.

Strengthening AI literacy is another key step. Building a foundational understanding of AI allows boards to engage more meaningfully, asking insightful questions and guiding the C-suite with a well-informed perspective. Boards can enhance this expertise by including members with AI backgrounds or consulting external specialists. “Boards always have a nose-in, feet-out orientation, but in this case, it’s really about asking the right questions and creating awareness,” explains Jane Stevenson, vice chair of Korn Ferry’s Board and CEO Services practice.

Finally, boards must champion responsible AI. Advocating for ethical AI practices—including transparency, bias mitigation and data privacy—will align AI use with organizational standards. Resources like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework provide valuable guidance in establishing governance frameworks that balance innovation with accountability.

Cybersecurity: Shielding Your Orbit From Cyber Threats

In space, a cybersecurity breach could have far-reaching, potentially catastrophic consequences. Space assets like satellites are exposed to unique cyber risks (hacking, signal jamming, data breaches) that can disrupt global communications, compromise national security and destabilize critical Earth-based infrastructure.

A cybersecurity approach that emphasizes layered security and defense in depth is essential to mitigate these high-stakes vulnerabilities. Such strategies, which combine multiple protective measures at different levels, create a robust defense framework, exemplified by entities like the U.S. Space Force and the European Space Agency. For boards, adopting these advanced security best practices emphasizes prioritizing cybersecurity as a critical strategic asset. This layered, proactive approach can serve as a model across all sectors, ensuring resilient defenses in an increasingly complex threat landscape.

Strengthening critical infrastructure is vital, but boards must shift their focus toward resilience. Focusing on identifying key risks and ensuring robust recovery strategies is essential, even with strong protections in place, to mitigate potential damage swiftly. Space organizations exemplify this approach by preparing meticulously for cyber incidents with comprehensive response protocols, including communication strategies, escalation procedures and recovery guidelines. Boards should advocate for similarly thorough incident response plans that address internal threats and third-party vulnerabilities, fostering a proactive, resilient approach to cybersecurity.

Collaboration is the final pillar of effective cybersecurity. Initiatives like the Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Space-ISAC) facilitate collective threat intelligence within the industry, providing space companies with critical insights to strengthen their security posture. Boards can encourage similar participation in industry-specific information-sharing programs to enhance resilience through shared intelligence. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) plays a crucial role in this collaborative effort. As the lead federal agency for protecting critical infrastructure, CISA has developed partnerships across the private sector, government and international entities to share timely, actionable information on cyber threats. By fostering such partnerships, CISA enables a coordinated response to cybersecurity threats that transcend geographic boundaries.

Leading Through Disruption

As we move into 2025, boards must embrace a forward-looking approach to navigate our rapidly shifting world's distinct challenges and unprecedented opportunities. The space industry’s pioneering strategies in AI and cybersecurity offer a powerful model, demonstrating how organizations can achieve resilience and drive innovation in an era marked by disruption. By studying these practices, boards can establish frameworks that foster responsible innovation, safeguard critical assets and build long-term resilience.

The message from the stars is clear: Success in a disruptive world is not about avoiding risk but mastering it with insight and strategy. Boards must take proactive ownership of AI oversight, advocate for advanced cybersecurity defenses and foster a culture prepared to pivot and adapt. By championing these strategies, boards can turn potential threats into powerful opportunities, positioning their organizations as leaders ready to thrive in 2025 and beyond.

This also makes them an appealing target for hacktivists looking to promote their cause—as seen in the high-profile attacks and stolen data during the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

A successful attack can cause significant disruptions, leading to huge financial and reputational repercussions for hosts, organizers and attendees or viewers alike, all while potentially playing out live on a national to global stage.

As the sports and entertainment industry continues to innovate and use new technology—for ticketing, data analytics, fan engagement/entertainment platforms and even controlling physical systems—the distributed nature of the sports industry across physical and digital ecosystems has become more complex to protect than ever before.

With billions of dollars pumped into planning for and hosting popular events like the NFL Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup 2026, organizations across the U.S. will soon be on the world’s biggest stage. Ensuring these events go off without a hitch is critical.

As the proliferation of accessible AI continues to increase the speed, scale and sophistication of cyberattacks, security teams must ensure they are prepared to protect game days against known and unknown threats—and can do so today.

Where Physical Meets Digital: Navigating The Complexities Of Sporting Event Security

The digital infrastructure underpinning sporting events is becoming increasingly complex, and the continued convergence of IT and OT infrastructure creates new opportunities and entry points for attackers.

Large venues consist of critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS), which include an array of switches, cables, CCTV cameras and more. This also includes devices being brought in by the media, suppliers and fans—who need access to be able to provide services or content.

This presents an access paradox, as security teams are presented with the unique challenges of enabling third parties to connect to their environment and monitor their activity while also ensuring their vital OT infrastructure, sensitive data or other business-critical information is protected.

During the launch, or ""D-day,"" of major events, organizers face an influx of thousands of uncontrolled users, suppliers, staff and devices needing to connect to a stadium’s network and infrastructure, blurring the line between cyber and physical security.

However, the successful navigation of these complexities is critical—because cyberattacks have the potential to not only threaten business performance but also human safety. An interruption to power systems can bring TV broadcasts and livestreams to a halt, or a disruption to access controls could restrict fans from entering the grounds, leading to dangerous overcrowding or widespread panic.

Since these mega events rarely can be postponed or replayed, time is of the essence. Every second counts in both major sporting events and cyber response, putting increased pressure on organizers to thwart threats or risk losing access to critical systems or even falling victim to ransom payments.

However, organizers equally can’t be over-aggressive in their actions like taking systems offline to protect them. The show must go on. Resilience and defending normal operations, while surgically disrupting anomalous malicious behavior, is critical.

Leveling the Playing Field

The best defense is a strong offense is as true on the playing field as it is in the cyber realm.

To get ahead of challenges, security teams must shift their mindset from reactive to proactive, with a greater focus on cyber resilience. Cyber threats are inevitable, and security teams must ensure their cybersecurity efforts go beyond static attempts at prevention to autonomous detection, response and recovery.

Cybersecurity best practices and a culture of cyber resilience must work in tandem to help organizations rapidly respond to a cyber threat, limit its potential business impact and return to normal function as quickly as possible.

The reality of cybersecurity is that threat actors only have to be successful once while defenders have to be vigilant every moment of every day. AI-powered tools have become critical for evening the operational playing field and staying one step ahead of challenges.

AI technologies can be deployed across complex environments, like stadiums, to develop an understanding of “normal” activity and then flag unusual activity or potential threats accordingly. AI can also initiate targeted responses at machine speed without relying on pre-programmed rules or established playbooks—and can even do so across an array of applications and IT/OT infrastructures without disrupting operations.

Organizations cannot protect against what they cannot see. An AI-powered approach better positions security teams to proactively identify internal and external vulnerabilities or gaps in their security before an attack—as well as break down organizational silos to investigate and remediate threats in real time to avoid disruption.

When considering AI in cybersecurity, it is critical to understand that not all AI is created equal. The right type of AI must be applied to the right security problem. Common techniques include:

• Supervised machine learning (ML) is often used to identify known attacks as they occur.

• Unsupervised ML approaches learn the pattern of life of an organization’s assets to perform anomaly detection.

• Generative AI or large language models (LLMs) can be used for data retrieval optimization, content summarization and generation.

Each technique has challenges. To evaluate the right AI solution for a specific use case, organizations must consider how the model was trained, the data integrity of training data and the transparency and explainability of decisions and outcomes AI presents.

Defending the End Zone

Given the increasingly complex threat landscape and the increased risks posed by geopolitical events, the importance of proactive cyber readiness cannot be overstated. The evolving capabilities of AI are simultaneously the biggest threat and biggest weapon for security teams.

By integrating AI alongside cybersecurity best practices and a culture of cyber resilience, security teams can focus on building proactive cyber resilience, better positioning them to protect landmark events and ensure a memorable experience for attendees, digital viewers, partners and players.

116,NaN,NI Water strike: Industrial action could have 'devastating impact',"NI Water strike could be 'devastating' for consumers

Getty Images Workers are asking for a 5% pay increase and a one-off payment of £1,500

More than 300 employees of NI Water and NI Water (Alpha) are set to begin industrial action next week in a dispute over pay. Members of Unite the union will begin a work-to-rule on 10 December, escalating to an all-out strike on 17 December. In a statement, Unite said the employees are the only civil service workers who have yet to receive a 5% pay increase and £1,500 non-consolidated payment from the 2023-24 tax year. The union has warned that the impact of industrial action will be ""devastating"" for consumers.

NI Water said the outstanding pay award for 2023-24 was ""a key concern"".

A ballot of members of the GMB union will close the end of this week and if they vote similarly, there will be a joint strike action by both unions. The strike would involve 250 members from Unite and 100 from GMB. NI Water workers took part in strike action in December 2014 until January 2015 with staff on a work-to-rule and an overtime ban. A subsequent review stated there was ""significant disruption to water supply in parts of Northern Ireland"" which ""resulted in consumers losing their water supply"". Unite regional officer Joanne McWilliams told BBC News NI that ""this time we are going further"". ""We are considering going all out,"" she said. ""If that happens we expect the consumer will be hit a lot quicker. ""It will be more devastating because we also have another aspect - we have NI Water (Alpha) who look after the four main treatment plants within Northern Ireland, so we do believe this is going to be devastating for the consumer.""

What does the strike mean for customers?

A work-to-rule would mean that employees at NI Water would stick completely to what is stated in the terms of their contract, meaning they would not start earlier or finish later than required. An overtime ban would prohibit staff working over and above their normal working hours and they would not call out to an emergency. ""We will take all requests for derogation on a case-by-case basis but on the face of it we will be withdrawing our labour,"" a Unite spokesperson said. When NI Water last undertook strike action in January 2015, the review found that ""loss of water supply occurred for some consumers in an area from Derrygonnelly to Dungiven and from Killeter to Cookstown"". The withdrawal of out-of-hours working meant that faults, which would have been repaired quickly in normal circumstances, resulted in failure or shutdown of some plants, causing consumers to lose their water supply.

117,NaN,"Storm Bert: Rain to increase as climate warms, says scientist","Rain to increase as climate warms, says scientist

BBC Scientists say the intensity of rain will increase as the climate continues to warm

Heavy rainfall and flooding will become more frequent as the climate continues to warm, according to a Bristol climate change scientist. The warning comes after Storm Bert lashed parts of the UK with heavy rainfall and strong winds, leading to at least five deaths. The storm caused widespread disruption across Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and South Gloucestershire, with damage to homes, shops and roads. ""We expect that the intensity of rain will increase as the climate continues to warm,"" said Dr Leanne Archer, research associate at the University of Bristol.

CarbonBrief/Met Office UK-based website Carbon Brief analysed data from the Met Office, showing that UK winters are getting warmer

She continued: ""So it will not only happen more frequently but when it does happen, the rain will be harder and that means that the water has to find somewhere to go much more quickly. ""That's more likely to lead to these kinds of flood impacts that we're seeing."" People were forced to leave their homes in Yate and the town centres of Bradford-on-Avon and Chippenham were brought to a standstill with roads and schools also closed on Monday. Speaking to the BBC in the aftermath of the storm, Ross Henning, Wiltshire councillor for Chippenham, said: ""Climate change is creeping up on us"". He added: ""There should be some mitigation put in place for people affected by floods. There are things that Wiltshire Council can do."" The Met Office's analysis of data from the past 100 years, analysed by UK website Carbon Brief, shows we can expect UK winters to continue to get wetter and warmer. Dr Archer said climate change scientists were already trying to understand how climate change shaped Storm Bert.

Dr Leanne Archer said the UK's current flood defences needed to be future-proofed

Contemplating the possible solutions to mitigate future flood risks, Dr Archer said: ""There is probably not one single solution but we definitely need to make sure that our current defences in place are future-proofed for our changing climate."" She added that the government should also ensure it had ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A government spokesperson said: ""We are prioritising our mission to become a clean energy superpower and accelerating the transition to net zero. ""Since July we have swept away barriers to onshore wind, consenting more than 2GW of solar and launched the publicly-owned Great British Energy to invest in renewables,"" they added. ""At COP29 we unveiled our ambitious and pragmatic new target to reduce emissions by 81% by 2035 - building on the legacy of the Climate Change Act.""

The pitch at Lydney Town AFC in Gloucestershire was submerged in flood water

Dr Archer also emphasised the need to protect new homes built near rivers and floodplains through the use of embankments or through the more natural floodplain management approach. ""We absolutely need to recognise that climate change is happening and our rainfall is becoming worse,"" said Ian Withers, the Environment Agency's director for Wessex. Mr Withers explained that the agency invests money from the government to put in place flood schemes that protect communities. ""There's a lot of work that we do with communities to understand how they can make their properties and businesses more resilient to flooding,"" he said. ""But our flood defences won't keep the water out forever. ""So our lifestyles and our businesses and our households need to be better protected to the risk of flooding."""

120,2024-12-02 00:00:00,The Mega-Universities Disrupting Higher Education,"ASU Tempe, Arizona, USA Drone Skyline Aerial Panorama getty

The theory of disruptive innovation suggests that new players can enter a marketplace by offering services to overlooked consumers, eventually reshaping entire industries. In the higher education sector, this theory has profound implications as emerging institutions challenge traditional models. This has resulted in a surge in enrollment at new low-cost, flexible institutions, many of which operate on online platforms and cater to working adults. This shift is giving rise to an increasing number of “mega-universities"" — massively scaled institutions that are rewriting some of the rules of higher education.

As these institutions scale, they also are shifting the “value proposition” of higher education to maximize convenience and efficiency over the traditional metrics of pure academic excellence, selectivity and world-class scholarship. For many students and their families these new criteria offer a different form of value. Michael Horn, co-Founder of the Clayton Christensen Institute, a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and a Forbes contributor, notes that for these largest institutions, “quality looks nothing like a traditional college or university — it's orthogonal to it” and suggests that instead of thinking of quality, it is better to consider value, which Horn defines as “outcomes divided by costs.”

The Growth Of The Mega-University

Within the United States, the largest single universities include Western Governors University, Southern New Hampshire University, and Arizona State University. This year, WGU's enrollment and SNHU enrolled 183,104 students. Other rising mega-universities include Liberty University, which currently enrolls 140,000 students, and Grand Canyon University, with a total enrollment of more than 118,000 students. Arizona State University enrolls nearly 80,000 students on-campus and more than 65,000 online learners, making it the third largest university in the U.S. ASU has accomplished this massive scale while retaining much of its legacy capacity for quality on-campus education and its ability for world-class research, focusing on interdisciplinary problems.

Other traditional universities have noticed ASU’s strategy of growth, promoted by its dynamic president Michael Crow as a “Fifth Wave University.” Examples include Purdue University, which started Purdue Global and now enrolls more than 45,000 students; the University of Maryland Global Campus, which was the 19th largest institution by enrollment in fall 2021 with 55,323 students; and the University of Central Florida, one of the fastest-growing universities in the country, with more than 82,000 students; and Texas A&M University, currently enrolling 77,000 students.

Scale, Quality And Value

The largest mega-universities are optimized for working adults and have developed flexible online platforms for learning, often enhanced with artificial intelligence. WGU’s competency-based education model enables students to demonstrate skill acquisition and complete courses at their own pace, instead of within fixed credit hours. ASU has expanded its online platform, ASU Digital Immersion, and with its partnership with OpenAI has launched an AI Innovation Challenge for faculty and staff to promote AI solutions across in all areas on campus. SNHU’s AI-powered chatbot ""Penny"" is designed to advise students on academics, finances, and wellness and has already increased student retention and performance. WGU has developed the Aera Decision Cloud platform to enable AI to predict student outcomes and recommend interventions to faculty.

Outcomes Divided By Costs

These mega-universities provide outcomes well below the most selective universities, but at a much more affordable cost. WGU and SNHU have graduation rates after eight years of 54% and 35%, compared to the national average six-year graduation rate of 67% for four-year universities, and 43% for community colleges. Top public universities such as UCLA, UC Berkeley, the University of Michigan, perform much better, with six-year graduation rates averaging above 90%, and the top Ivy+ universities graduate more than 96% of students over six years, but with much different student populations.

Few traditional universities arguably can compete with the efficiency and cost of the mega-university, however. WGU’s competency-based model results in an average degree completion time of just 2.5 years — far more efficient that traditional universities. And the costs are hard to beat — WGU and SNHU offer an annual tuition of approximately $8,010 and $9,600, respectively. These figures compare very well to four-year public universities, which charge an average annual tuition of $9,750 and $27,500 for in- and out-of state students, and with private universities, which charge more than $38,000 annually for tuition.

Quality At Scale?

The mega-university student experience is drastically different from the traditional university. In many cases, students never meet their professors and take “asynchronous” courses that provide little if any interaction with faculty. In most cases, faculty focus purely on teaching and can’t offer mentoring in research. Students have few, if any, opportunities for interactive experiences on campus that research shows are a central component of a “transformative” and high-quality education.

Horn counters by noting that “no one's comparing why you go to Southern New Hampshire with why you go to Harvard University, but I think both are extremely high quality with what they're optimized on” which are “a very different set of things.” Horn places the question of quality in context, saying that “quality to me is always relative to the job to be done.” Horn notes that since “Western Governors and Southern New Hampshire University are specifically solely dedicated to teaching and learning, the quality is actually extremely enhanced by the scale because the amount of data they're able to take in on students.” This data enables the massively scaled university to conduct research on teaching and learning to “create enormous gains in the personalized experiences that follow what we know from the learning sciences,” and Horn adds that, “traditional universities are focused on research but know very little about teaching and learning.”

Even with less interaction with faculty, students at mega-universities benefit from intense focus on student support. Institutions like SNHU and WGU have “unbundled the role of the faculty member” and instead provide “a life coach who is with you from day one through the end,” according to Horn. Additional features of these universities include teaching coaches, and additional expertise in instruction within faculty such as WGU’s faculty that is dedicated to assessment.

The Future Of Higher Education

The rapid growth of these giant universities could indeed be a disruption of higher education, where flexibility, affordability, and accessibility take precedence over the traditional campus experience, which fewer students can afford. According to Horn,” when we think about disruption of the higher ed experience, we're not creative enough with how big higher education should encompass.” The disruption of higher education may include other models entirely, even beyond our present-day mega-universities. Yet without a better return on investment, or ROI, many traditional universities are threatened, or as Horn puts it, “there's a lot of institutions and programs today that are negative in ROI and that's the part that needs to get disrupted.”"
121,2024-12-02 00:00:00,How Manufacturing Leaders Can Navigate Future Industry Disruptions,"Kerrie Jordan is the Group Vice President, Product Management at Epicor.

getty

Manufacturing has a bright outlook today. New projects and job creation have been boosted by recent legislation, including the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.

However, there are still big challenges that manufacturing leaders must address not just to be successful but to be able to scale and grow. These include challenges like how they’ll integrate emerging technologies, create an environment where workers feel engaged, weather supply chain disruptions and keep pace with modernization.

Based on data from our “Future of Work in Manufacturing” report, here's how manufacturing leaders can navigate the challenges in their industry today to prevent future disruptions tomorrow.

1. Anticipating AI And Automation

Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are technologies quickly becoming key players in manufacturing operations. Integrating these technologies can help reduce human error, increase efficiency and save costs. But 73% of manufacturing managers and 53% of workers believe their jobs will change with the introduction of automation.

We are in a golden age of innovation across sectors and job functions, but especially within manufacturing. These technologies can be tools to help manufacturers become more efficient in a variety of ways, and we continue to discover new applications.

Taking Action

Integrating AI and automation are likely to be standards of modernization going forward—especially when 76% of manufacturing leaders see AI as having the potential to optimize production schedules and identify inefficiencies, and 51% see its potential for price forecasting of raw materials.

To fully realize these benefits, it’s essential to evaluate where these technologies can create the most efficiencies in your organization, from back-office analytics to automation on the factory floor. While automation offers significant benefits, it's important to understand the complexity and gradual nature of adoption, especially when balancing current workloads and budget constraints.

As these new technologies will need to be learned and managed, I recommend leveraging support from training programs like the National Association of Manufacturers, the Manufacturing Institute and the Association for Manufacturing Technology.

2. Uncertain Job Outlook

Manufacturing leaders also need to ensure that they're fostering a productive and engaging environment for their workers. Thirty-nine percent of manufacturing workers and 47% of manufacturing managers said their turnover has increased over the past year.

Losing employees is disruptive for everyone, but especially so for the hiring managers, which may account for the perceived difference. While job opportunities seem to be growing in the manufacturing sector, retaining workers requires strategies around increasing engagement and morale.

Taking Action

Look at developing strategies to increase morale and engagement among your workers but also supervisors and other middle managers. This can start with offering bonuses, paid time off or more flexible scheduling. It also includes ensuring that employees are listened to and appreciated in other ways.

Actively listen to worker feedback around their suggestions for improvements, and take action to address their concerns, especially when it comes to safety. This is especially important when 73% of workers who feel like their voice is heard say that leads to them being empowered to do their best work.

Recognize them for their contributions to the organization by setting up a rewards program so they can feel seen and appreciated. Give them opportunities to grow in the organization by offering professional development or training programs.

3. Supply Chain Disruptions

In recent years, the manufacturing industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions across the globe. While those disruptions appear to be stabilizing, manufacturing companies know they can't simply go back to the old way of doing things, given new disruptions could happen any day. Instead, manufacturing leaders need strategies to increase their supply chain resilience.

Taking Action

Creating a resilient and sustainable supply chain starts by increasing visibility into the supply chain so that disruptions can be anticipated. This can be accomplished by adding digital tracking tools like IoT devices and by adopting technologies like blockchain for more transparency.

Even more established supply chain automation technologies like EDI can help. Look for opportunities to diversify suppliers and leverage AI for more accurate forecasting, as using AI for forecasting can reduce errors by upwards of 40%.

4. Lagging Modernization

Another challenge today that will cause future disruptions tomorrow is a lack of commitment to modernization and failure to bring in technologies that can increase digitization, efficiency and scalability. In 2024, only 39% of manufacturing workers and 52% of manufacturing managers rated their workplace as ""very modern.""

Taking Action

Companies that invest in technology and “smart factory” initiatives see a 10% to 12% gain in output, utilization and productivity. To keep up with your industry, start by exploring which technologies you can invest in that will help move your organization forward in terms of efficiency, cost savings, time savings or other benefits.

Pinpoint areas where human errors are common and start there. These could be initiatives like digitizing paper documents, automating processes, data analytics, cloud adoption, 3D printing, digital twins and more. As you adopt new technologies, include a strategy for training as well.

Creating The Future Of Manufacturing Today

Manufacturing has a bright outlook today, but manufacturing leaders must seek out learning opportunities, challenge their historic norms and take action to implement resilient growth strategies. By successfully integrating emerging technologies, creating an environment where workers feel engaged, weathering supply chain disruptions and keeping pace with modernization, manufacturing leaders can set themselves up today to be prepared for the disruptions of tomorrow.

122,2024-12-01 00:00:00,How Companies Can Guard Against A Tariff-Related Supply Chain Crisis,"The nation’s fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis ... [+] if President-elect Donald Trump’s carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. 3d illustration getty

The nation’s fragile supply chains and the businesses that depend on them will face another crisis if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico.

“These tariffs will inevitably increase costs which we already know, as they act as a tax on imported goods, and very likely will disrupt the flow of trade by adding complexity to customs processes and extending lead times that are already quite long,” Amanda Russo, founder and CEO at Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting, predicted in an email message.

There is a sense of urgency for corporate executives to prepare for the looming crisis. That’s because “once companies experience a supply chain disruption, it takes them an average of two weeks to plan and execute a response,” according to an October report about supply chain vulnerabilities by McKinsey & Company.

Proactive Measures

There are steps business leaders can take now to to prepare for and help lessen the impact of a tariff-fueled crisis as much as possible.

Seek Supply Chain Alternatives

“Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains by making imported components more expensive or less accessible. Companies may need to seek alternative suppliers, which can be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to production delays, Tanya Wade, a senior manager at KPMG, noted via email.

Trump’’s tariffs could also create additional crisis situations.

“Targeted countries may respond with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, affecting American businesses that rely on international markets. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to broader trade conflicts, further destabilizing supply chains,” she pointed out.

Stockpile Inventory

""The first thing businesses may want to do is to bring in inventory early prior to any new tariffs being imposed. This approach has to be weighed against the financial risk of sitting on aging inventory but, depending on the product and position of the company, it is something to consider,” Paul F. Magel, president of the application solutions division of Computer Generated Solutions, advised via email.

Diversify

""Another way that businesses can proactively mitigate the impact of potentially higher tariffs is by re-evaluating their supply chains and considering strategic diversification of sourcing and production to areas where tariffs are not being imposed,” he counseled.

There could be a silver lining to tariffs for some companies.

""Higher tariffs can also create opportunities for businesses to increase their competitiveness by exploring domestic or near-shore production and forming new partnerships that reduce exposure to tariff-related costs,” Magel concluded.

There is more than one way companies could guard help against the impact of tariffs.

Manage Financial Impact

“Managing the financial impact of tariffs has also become a priority. Businesses are looking for ways to offset increased costs by improving operational efficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or adjusting pricing strategies. Technology plays a growing role in this process, as companies adopt advanced supply chain management tools to monitor risks, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time,” Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management, observed in an email interview.

Plan Ahead

“Another critical step is engaging in proactive planning. Companies are developing contingency strategies to account for a range of tariff scenarios, modeling how different levels of import duties might affect their pricing, demand, and operations. Many are also working with industry groups and policymakers to advocate for exemptions or adjustments that could mitigate the impact on their sectors,” he commented.

Stocking up on inventory now is one way that companies can help protect themselves against a ... [+] tariff-related supply chain crisis. getty





Challenges

The survey by McKinsey & Company that was released in October underscores the major challenges companies face in preparing for supply chain disruptions.

Talent Shortages

“A shortage of talent, particularly digital talent, continues to hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of those surveyed, 90% say that their companies lack sufficient talent to meet their digitization goals. That number hasn’t changed in any meaningful way since the first survey in 2020,” the report observed.

A Lack Of Understanding Of Risk

“The biggest gap could be the one at the top of the organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe that their boards have an in-depth understanding of supply chain risk. Only a quarter have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain issues at board level. All this could leave companies dangerously exposed to future disruptions,” according to the survey results.

Fewer Discussions

“Perhaps more concerning is a steep drop in the frequency that supply chain risks are discussed at a senior-management level. In the 2023 survey, almost one-half of respondents said that their organizations had a regular reporting cadence for supply chain risk. This year, that share dropped to one-quarter, with most companies reverting to ad hoc reporting in response to disruptions or the emergence of major new risks,” the report pointed out.

Going Forward

Don’t Fly Blind

“If you’re not mapping your supply chain down to tier three, four, or five, you’re flying blind. You need to know where your suppliers may feel a tariff crunch,” Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, an AI-powered supply chain management company,” advised in an email interview.

Rethink Supply Chains

“At the end of the day, this isn’t just about tariffs. It’s about rethinking how we build and manage supply chains. It’s about moving from reactive to proactive. Companies that take this moment seriously—invest in resilience, embrace technology, and build partnerships—will not just weather the storm; they’ll come out stronger. This is the time to turn disruption into opportunity,” he commented.

Evolve

“Ultimately, the tariffs underscore the critical need for supply chains to be both resilient and adaptable. Organizations that fail to evolve risk severe disruptions and escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities such as supplier dependency and reliance on manual processes, companies can better position themselves to thrive in an unpredictable trade landscape,” Amanda Russo of Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies and organizations have faced a number of supply chain crises over the years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal by a cargo container ship, and the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Businesses who don’t take steps now to protect themselves as much as possible from a tariff-related supply chain crisis will only have themselves to blame if and when it—or another crisis—strikes."
123,NaN,Fleming Way: pedestrian disruption set to reduce as work progresses,"Improved route to open after diversion 'hardship'

BBC Liam Hill-Davis, project manager, said he felt the ""real hardship"" for people who have had to walk around the site

Pedestrians will have better access to a town centre for the festive shopping season because of progress made on a multi-million pound construction project. Work began on Swindon's £33m Bus Boulevard scheme in April 2022, with pedestrians facing long diversions and drivers suffering traffic disruption since September 2022 when Fleming Way was closed. However, from 5 December, people will once again be able to walk directly into the town centre from the current bus station. The Bus Boulevard aims to give Swindon a greener, prettier and more functional bus station, and is set for completion in summer 2025, 12 months later than scheduled.

A long walk for pedestrians around the Bus Boulevard construction site will end on 5 December

""We felt the real hardship for those walking around the site"" said project manager, Liam Hill-Davis. Direct access from the current bus station to the town centre will no longer include the old subway which has been removed as part of the redevelopment. ""We'd like to thank everyone for their cooperation and understanding,"" added Mr Hill-Davis.

Work began on Swindon's £33m Bus Boulevard scheme in April 2022

The scheme faced delays shortly after construction began when it was discovered telecommunication cables were not buried deep enough for the new designs. Mr Hill-Davis said: ""It took a lot of expertise between the contractors, Swindon Borough Council and the utilities companies to coordinate how to get the work done.""

Leader of Swindon Borough Council, Jim Robbins, said the long-term benefits of the project would outweigh the short-term pain

Jim Robbins, leader of Swindon Borough Council, said he recognised the disruption the work had caused but remained ""hopeful"" that the ""long-term benefits will outweigh the pain people have had to deal with in the short-term"". Once the Bus Boulevard opens the old bus station will be demolished, which Robbins viewed as one of the biggest benefits, he said: ""That's the prize everybody can look forward to. ""That building is not a nice space, it's not a safe space.""

Landscape work is ongoing as part of the redevelopment

Councillor Chris Watts, cabinet member for transport and environment, said the scheme would provide ""value for money"". ""It is an incredibly important piece of land as far as the town centre regeneration is concerned,"" said Mr Watts.

124,NaN,Disruption at flooded Northampton station enters third day,"'Work around the clock' to repair flooded rail line

National Rail Flooding can damage tracks and signalling, like at Northampton

Passengers are being warned that rail disruption is likely to continue for the rest of the week as repairs to flood-damaged equipment continue. National Rail said engineers continued to ""work around the clock"" after the River Nene burst its banks and caused severe flooding at Northampton station. Signals and other railway equipment were submerged in water for hours during Storm Bert and must be cleaned, repaired and tested before trains can safely run, the body said. Trains are being diverted away from Northampton, and road replacement transport between Rugby and Northampton - and Northampton and Milton Keynes - will be provided, it added.

West Midlands Trains confirmed that the station had reopened and a ""reduced timetable"" would be able to resume on Wednesday evening.

National Rail Services were originally not expected to resume before Thursday due to the scale of the repairs

National Rail Passengers should prepare for disruption until the end of the week, National Rail said

National Rail ""We’re really sorry to everyone affected and will keep passengers informed about our ongoing repairs,"" said the director for Network Rail’s West Coast South route, Gary Walsh

Passengers have been advised to check their journeys before travelling due to disruption on the West Coast Main Line through Northampton station. Director for Network Rail’s West Coast South route, Gary Walsh, said: ""We’re working as quickly as possible to repair the extensive damage caused by Storm Bert at Northampton station. ""Our priority is safety, so we’re carrying out rigorous checks and repairs on hundreds of pieces of signalling equipment to ensure everything works properly before reopening. ""Due to the complex nature of this work, we’re advising passengers that journeys through Northampton are likely to be disrupted for the rest of the week and we’re urging people to check before they travel with their train operator.""

'So much destroyed'

Paul Diggin, an ex-Saints player who is now involved with the Northampton BBOB Rugby Club, said their club house, near the railway station, had been ""wiped out"". He told BBC Radio Northampton that during the big 1998 flood in Northampton about one foot of water had entered the club house. But over the weekend, he estimated that levels had reached four feet. He said the club has lost both function rooms, tables, chairs, two skittles tables, the kitchen - gym, changing rooms and a store room with leisure wear and training kit. ""So much has been destroyed,"" he said. ""It is completely wrecked.. we are going to be struggling for a bit. ""The good thing is [the pitches] drain quite well so as soon as it resides we can get back to training but can't use any changing rooms or toilets, so we are literally 'wanderers rugby'."" Mr Diggin said, like many others in the town, the club would have to wait for their insurance providers before any work could be carried out. ""It's awful, its a community club and we get most of our money from across the bar,"" he said. ""Everyone is gutted. It is out of our hands how quick it progresses... every day we aren't there working on it is a day closer to the end of the season, it's worrying.""

Seoul residents awoke to a gleaming world of white this week, as record snowfall caused both disruption and delight across the South Korean capital.

The city recorded 16.1 centimeters (6.3 inches) of snow on Wednesday – the heaviest daily snowfall in November since records began in 1907, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).

The previous record, set in 1966, saw 9.5 cm (3.7 inches) of snow.

Further heavy snow fell throughout the day and overnight; by Thursday morning parts of Yongin city, south of the capital, had recorded 47.5 centimeters (18.7 inches) of snow, according to KMA.

Photos of the capital show trees sagging under the weight of the snow, and Seoul’s iconic palaces blanketed in white. Residents bundled up in thick coats, with some throwing snowballs, building snowmen and reveling in the fluffy snow.

They weren’t the only ones enjoying the wintry wonderland.

The country’s first ever twin panda cubs – born to nationwide enthusiasm last July – were seen frolicking at the Everland theme park and zoo Wednesday, sliding down a snowy field. It was the cubs’ first time experience in snow after keepers kept them indoors last winter to protect them from the elements, Reuters reported.

But the snow also brought widespread disruption, with travel halted in many places and transportation services suspended.

Hundreds lost power in cities near the capital including Gwangju, the Associated Press reported.

More than 150 flights nationwide were canceled or delayed between Tuesday and Thursday, while over 100 ferry services were restricted, the Interior Ministry said. At least 18 roads around Seoul faced restrictions due to the snow, with authorities adding extra subway trains to accommodate the extra demand on public transit.

Local authorities said they were investigating three deaths that were potentially linked to the bad weather.

In Wonju, southeast of Seoul, there was a multi-car pileup on a highway, with videos showing emergency workers surveying damaged cars and directing slow-moving vehicles in other lanes.

Key Facts

A cold front is expected to sweep the Midwest and South starting Wednesday night and spread eastward on Thanksgiving Day, bringing precipitation and frigid temperatures. Winter storms hit California and Nevada's Sierra Nevada Tuesday and moved to Colorado and Utah Wednesday, where up to 36 inches of snow is expected to fall in parts of the mountains by the evening and up to 4 inches could fall in the Denver metro area. The storm is expected to continue moving east and move into the Midwest and Ohio Valley, which could see up to an inch of snow, and then into the Northeast, where low pressure tracking near New England is bringing the potential for widespread rain and snow from Thursday into Friday morning. Snowfall on Thursday and into Friday is possible in northern New York and Vermont, and rain and high-elevation snow could be seen on Thanksgiving in northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts and eastern New York. A winter storm watch is in effect from late Thursday through Friday morning in western New York, the eastern Catskills, parts of Vermont and Delaware, and extends to the Eastern Lake Onatrio region from Friday afternoon through Monday. Those traveling by car in areas from Boston to New York City should be prepared for a wet drive, be it snow or heavy rain. A surge of cold the weekend after Thanksgiving will send freezing weather to the Great Lakes Midwest and Northeast with high temperatures in the 20s expected in Chicago, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio.

What To Watch For

How weather impacts travel. Almost 80 million people are expected to travel more than 50 miles between Tuesday and next Monday for the holiday. Car travel is expected to overtake pre-pandemic levels—70.6 million people drove to their Thanksgiving destinations in 2019, AAA reports, and 71.7 million are expected to do so this year. Almost 6 million people are expected to fly domestically, up 11% from 2019 and international bookings are up 23% compared to last Thanksgiving. Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons are the worst time to travel by car, AAA reported, with road congestion also expected almost all day Sunday, particularly after 1 p.m.

Surprising Fact

It's been five years since Thanksgiving brought seriously destructive winter weather to portions of the United States. In 2019, a bomb cyclone brought almost hurricane-force winds to the West Coast and rains that flooded San Diego. Hail fell in Los Angeles the day before Thanksgiving, and three members of an Arizona family died after their truck was swept away in a flooded creek. The year before, in 2018, New York City saw the coldest Thanksgiving since 1901 when temperatures in Central Park hit 19 degrees and East Coast other cities, including Washington D.C., also had near record-breakingly cold temperatures.

Update, Nov. 27, 2024: This story, originally published Nov. 26 now includes more information from Starbucks as well security experts concerning the wider implications of the Blue Yonder ransomware attack.

A cyber attack, confirmed as being ransomware, against the AI-driven supply chain platform Blue Yonder is having a broader impacts on both sides of the pond: Starbucks in the U.S. is said to be affected as as at least two of the big four U.K. retail supermarket chains. Here’s what we know so far.

Forbes Don’t Hold Down The Ctrl Key—New Warning As Cyber Attacks Confirmed

Blue Yonder Falls Victim To Ransomware—Retailers Feel The Heat

Blue Yonder describes itself as a world leader in digital supply chain transformation with an AI-driven platform that helps with everything from fulfillment to delivery logistics. When a global retail supply chain player gets hit by ransomware you can be sure the ripples will spread across both sides of the pond, and that’s the case with a cyber attack that was confirmed by Blue Yonder as taking place on Nov. 21. “Blue Yonder experienced disruptions to its managed services hosted environment, which was determined to be the result of a ransomware incident,” an official statement said, “Our investigation remains ongoing, but please know that our priority is to ensure a safe and secure recovery. At this point in time, we do not have a timeline for restoration.” The last update to the situation from Blue Yonder was posted on Nov. 24 and stated that the incident response continued to progress but was still unable to confirm a timeline for full-service restoration.

Reuters has reported that Starbucks has been affected by the ransomware attack on Blue Yonder, impacting barista schedule management and payments as a back-end process has been disrupted. A Starbucks spokesperson told Reuters that the incident “is not impacting its customer service, and the company was working to ensure its employees were fully paid for their hours worked with limited disruption or discrepancy.”

I reached out to Starbucks for further information, and a spokesperson, who didn’t want to be quoted directly, told me that Starbucks was working as quickly as possible to ensure that all employees were being paid fully for their hours worked and without disruption or discrepancy to the best of its ability. This is because Blue Yonder provided a back-end Starbucks process which enables the employee hours platform, tracking hours worked and also enabling those employees to view and manage their schedules. The Starbucks spokesperson told me that it had been able to process payroll as planned and that company has the functionality in place to ensure those who are scheduled to work on Thanksgiving receive holiday pay as anticipated. Starbucks wanted to clarify that the Blue Yonder incident was having no impact upon customers directly, and its stores were open and serving coffee as usual.

Two of the big four supermarket chains in the U.K., Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, are also reported to have been impacted by the Blue Yonder ransomware attack.

Meanwhile, a Sainsbury’s spokesperson told the same trade publication that it was “in close contact with Blue Yonder and can reassure our customers we have contingencies in place.”

""The recent ransomware attack on Blue Yonder highlights the importance of having predetermined secure measures in place within supply chains,” Jake Moore, the global cybersecurity advisor at ESET, said. “Organizations need to carry out thorough risk assessments to identify typical vulnerabilities in their supply chain networks, including all those from third-party vendors.” Moore advised that standard security protocols such as regular software updates, staff training and stringent access controls “are often overlooked but fall straight into supply chain attackers’ hands. By proactively addressing known attack entry points,” he concluded, “businesses have a much better chance in resilience against such threats.""

This is a developing story, which I will revisit as more updates about the ongoing impact of, and recovery from, the ransomware attack become available."

This week has the potential to bring a wave of messy weather across the United States as travellers hit the roads and airports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The National Weather Service is predicting ""messy Thanksgiving travel"" in the eastern US with a mix of rain and snow in some areas. The disruptions come during what historically has been the busiest travel days of the year in the US. Rain and snow are also expected in the Pacific Northwest, which is still recovering after a large storm killed two people last week. Temperatures are expected to drop across most of the country.

The east coast will see the worst weather toward the end of the week and closer to the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. A low pressure system is expected to bring rain across the eastern seaboard. It could also bring snow to higher elevations and colder states in the north-east, including Maine and New Hampshire. The south-east is also expecting rain on Thursday and a cold front. In the midwest and Great Lakes region, there's a possibility for heavy lake-effect snow by the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. Even the western US won't be spared wet weather.

132,2024-11-25 00:00:00,How Generative AI Is Disrupting Today's Advertising Agency Model,"Rafael Schwarz is managing director at TERRITORY Influence, a leading social media and influencer marketing agency.

The income structures within advertising agencies have shifted dramatically over the last century, with generative AI poised to disrupt them once more. This analysis traces the historical evolution of agency revenue models, outlines the imminent impacts of generative AI on these structures and suggests how agencies can sustain their competitive edge through original ideation, culturally relevant narratives and unparalleled human creativity.

A Brief History Of Advertising Agencies And Their Income Models

In the early stages of the advertising industry, agencies primarily functioned as brokers of ad space, generating revenue through a relatively straightforward mark-up model. They would acquire newspaper ad spaces in bulk and resell them to brands at a higher price, collecting commissions on these sales. This transactional income model, emerging in the 19th century, positioned agencies as media intermediaries rather than creative or strategic partners.

By the mid-20th century, a full-service approach gained prominence, as agencies started offering creative services like copywriting, design and campaign production. With the rise of television in the 1950s, agencies became true strategic partners of advertisers, developing brand strategy, storytelling ideas and campaign execution, while still managing media planning and buying.

In the 1980s, as media landscapes and channels diversified, advertisers began decoupling media and creative accounts. While traditional agencies refocused on creative development, newly formed specialized media agencies managed the buying and planning of media. This separation caused a shift from commission-based earnings to fees for brand development, campaign execution and asset creation.

The digital age of the 1990s introduced new service domains, such as SEO and digital marketing. As social media platforms proliferated, agencies scaled these services, with SEO, web design and social media management becoming essential offerings. In fact, the explosion of social media platforms coupled with technological tools for more personalization created an inflationary demand for branded content and digital marketing services.

Today, SEO and website design are the top services provided by agencies today, followed by PPC and social media marketing. Consequently, the bulk of income for most agencies derives from content production across multiple platforms, especially digital and social media. In fact, most agencies’ revenue models looks like a Gauss curve, with very little income generated at the beginning or the end of any new campaign development process.

The Promise And Peril Of Generative AI For Advertising Agencies

Generative AI’s transformative potential could reinvent the marketing landscape—and with it, the role of advertising agencies. Campaigns that once required extensive development periods of many months may soon be crafted in mere minutes. McKinsey & Company says projects that use generative AI could amplify marketing productivity by an estimated 5% to 15% of total marketing spend, translating to roughly $463 billion annually.

Generative AI has the potential to replace key agency services, from crafting ad copy to designing logos, producing photography and even video shooting. Large language models like ChatGPT can already generate copy, product descriptions and other assets, eliminating the need for dedicated copywriters and editors. Visual tools like DALL-E and Midjourney enable the creation of high-quality images and video, reducing reliance on traditional graphic resources at creative agencies. Adobe’s recent launch of a generative AI video model for Premiere Pro is emblematic of this shift, allowing commercially safe, streamlined video production for brands.

According to a recent Boston Consulting Group survey, over 70% of CMOs are already utilizing generative AI for content creation, personalization and segmentation—thereby challenging the traditional revenue model of advertising agencies by diminishing billable hours typically associated with content production.

Forging A New Agency Business Model In The Age Of AI

In a marketing ecosystem reshaped by AI, advertising agencies must pivot toward tasks where human creativity and strategic foresight surpass machine capabilities. As AI assumes the role of content production, creative and digital agencies should concentrate on areas requiring human-centric skills:

Brand Consulting: Agencies should support clients with differentiated brand strategy and positioning that leverages AI data while preserving brand heritage, identity and purpose.

Agencies should hence refocus their capabilities and teams in developing bold, culturally relevant campaigns. Campaign Data And Insights: Leveraging AI’s capability to analyze vast amounts of data, agencies should furnish clients with insights about the performance of specific campaign iterations, optimizing future advertising through data-informed adjustments.

Conclusion: Realigning Agency Priorities To Differentiate Through Human Creativity

Today, advertising agencies derive substantial income from the production of ads, creative assets and digital content. However, with advancements in generative AI, the monetizable hours traditionally tied to creative or digital agencies are under siege. This technological shift will force agencies to concentrate on what AI cannot yet fully replicate: high-level strategy, ideation and consumer insight.

While AI will efficiently produce a multitude of ad variations, the nuanced ideation, strategic acumen and in-depth consumer understanding of agencies will remain invaluable. Agencies that realign their priorities toward cultivating breakthrough ideas and crafting culturally relevant narratives can leverage AI as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, human ingenuity. Embracing this hybrid model should enable agencies to retain relevance and sustain growth, capitalizing on AI’s potential while preserving the essence of human-driven creativity.

A significant Microsoft outage disrupted global access to essential services such as Outlook, Teams and Exchange Online, leaving businesses, government agencies and individual users grappling with the consequences. Beginning early Monday morning, the outage has escalated, with over 5,000 users reporting issues by 12 p.m. Eastern Time on Downdetector. Microsoft said that the issues have now been resolved.

At 4 a.m. ET on Monday, the company acknowledged the issue, stating that ""we're investigating an issue impacting users attempting to access Exchange Online or functionality within Microsoft Teams calendar. For more information, please refer to MO941162 in the admin center.""

Teams, Outlook, Exchange, SharePoint—All Impacted

The outage has hit Microsoft Teams’ calendar functionality, Outlook email services, Exchange Online and SharePoint—tools fundamental to the workflows of millions, as reported by BleepingComputer. Major urban centers like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Tampa are experiencing notable service disruptions. While some users report partial functionality, such as receiving emails without the ability to download attachments, others remain completely offline.

For businesses, this outage has a cascading effect. Teams meetings are delayed, project timelines are disrupted and employees must scramble for alternative communication methods. In a world increasingly reliant on digital tools for productivity, interruptions like this underscore how dependent we have become on seamless cloud services.

This incident follows a notable July 2024 disruption linked to CrowdStrike’s software, which caused chaos across industries including healthcare and aviation. That event culminated in Delta Air Lines filing lawsuits against CrowdStrike and Microsoft, alleging negligence and damages stemming from the outage. These recurring incidents underscore the vulnerability of even the most sophisticated cloud infrastructures.

Storm Bert: Football team swims in flooded pitch

More rain is due to fall in the coming hours and into Wednesday in southern England and south Wales, where flooding and high winds from Storm Bert have caused major disruption to homes, roads and rail networks. At least five people have died in the storm that struck much of the UK over the weekend and prompted criticism about a lack of preparation and insufficient warnings. The severe flood warning for the River Nene in Northamptonshire remains in force with a ""danger to life and risk of significant disruption"", as a holiday park has been submerged for the third time this year. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said more flooding was likely this week but it should be ""less severe"" than on Sunday.

At least 300 properties have been flooded across the UK. Residents of flood-hit areas are being left with major clean-up jobs, with one business owner telling the BBC her store had been devastated. ""Everything's been wiped out this time,"" said Laura Jones, whose crafts shop in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, was hit. ""Business is totally finished, flooding has wiped us out one too many times."" Politicians and residents in south Wales, one of the areas worst hit by the flooding, have criticised what they say is a lack of preparation and insufficient warning from officials. In Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, locals said lessons had not been learnt from Storm Dennis, which left much of the town under water in 2020. One resident, Paula, said authorities ""promised us the world, and delivered absolutely nothing"". Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said he was ""amazed"" that only a yellow weather warning was put in place. The Met Office said it would conduct a full assessment of the ""forecast and warning system"" for Storm Bert as it does for any named storm. It added the storm was ""well forecast"" in advance with a number of warnings issued ahead of its arrival. Natural Resources Wales said the government body would ""absolutely"" look into complaints about a lack of preparedness. Heledd Fychan, Plaid Cymru Senedd member for South Wales Central, said the warnings came too late: ""It's just by luck that it wasn't worse than this.""

The Environment Agency issued more than 100 warnings – meaning flooding is expected – and nearly 140 flood alerts across England on Monday. Six flood warnings remain in place in Wales with some residents in south-east Wales being advised to boil their water before using it to avoid contamination. Scotland has been less affected by floods, with five warnings and alerts in place. But Storm Bert is now tracking eastwards across Scotland, bringing heavy showers and strong winds. The Highlands had the last remaining weather warning for the storm. In Northampton, the only area still covered by a severe flood warning, police have warned against all unnecessary travel. The local fire and rescue service said it was working to evacuate the Billing Aquadrome holiday park, with around 1,000 affected. This is the third time this year the park has flooded. A 94-year-old woman told the BBC she was able to escape the rising water in her home on Saturday using her stair lift in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. And, in West Yorkshire a father pulled his baby from the window of his car and carried him above his head after the vehicle entered deep flood water.

Some train operators cancelled services on Monday due to flooded lines. Great Western Railway, which runs trains between London and south-west England, advised passengers not to travel on any of its routes. West Midlands Railway warned of severe disruption to some of its routes after flooding in Northamptonshire. National Rail has warned of disruption across England, Wales and Scotland and advised customers to check their routes before travelling. Many roads around the UK have been closed in flood-hit areas.

Severe flooding has also prompted school closures, with more than 40 closed across Wales, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire on Monday morning. Some 57 children were rescued from a school bus near Evesham, Worcestershire, when it became stuck in a flooded ditch. Students were ferried to dry land in a fire service rescue boat.

136,2024-11-25 00:00:00,Starbucks forced to pay its baristas manually because of a ransomware attack on third-party software,"CNN —

A ransomware attack has disrupted a third-party software system that Starbucks uses to track and manage its baristas’ schedules, forcing the coffee chain to shift to manual mode to ensure its employees get paid properly, a Starbucks spokesperson said Monday.

Starbucks’ store leadership have advised their employees on how to work around the outage manually, and the company will make sure everyone gets paid for all hours worked, according to Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson.

Starbucks joins a growing list of companies disrupted by the hack of Blue Yonder, an Arizona-based cloud services provider that serves grocery stores and Fortune 500 firms. Two of the top four grocery chains in the United Kingdom told CNN over the weekend that they were taking steps to deal with the Blue Yonder outage.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that Starbucks was impacted by the Blue Yonder hack.

Automaker Ford said Monday that it was investigating any potential impact.

“Ford is aware and is actively investigating if a cyber incident at a third-party supplier has any impact on our operations or systems,” said Ford spokesperson Ian Thibodeau.

A range of major multinational corporations use Blue Yonder cloud services to manage their supply chains. The company has declined to answer questions about which of its clients were affected by the hack. Blue Yonder’s latest public statement says it is “working around the clock to respond to this incident and continues to make progress.”

Since the hackers struck last week, Blue Yonder has been scrambling to work with US-based clients to mitigate any impacts on customers.

Blue Yonder has hired US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to recover from the hack, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. A CrowdStrike spokesperson referred questions to Blue Yonder.

Ransomware attacks typically lock computer systems so that hackers can demand an extortion fee. Cybercriminals extorted a record $1.1 billion in ransom payments from victim organizations around the world in 2023 despite US government efforts to cut off their money flows, according to crypto-tracking firm Chainalysis.

Ransomware attacks are pervasive throughout the year, but the holiday shopping season can be a particularly opportune time for hackers to strike as companies rush to fill orders.

Cybersecurity firm Semperis found that 86% of surveyed organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany that faced ransomware attacks were targeted on a holiday or weekend.

The disruption is the latest challenge facing new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who is grappling with three consecutive quarters of declining sales."

Great Western Railway (GWR) said on Monday morning more than 16 floods across its network had severely delayed trains in Berkshire. It later said lines were blocked between Newbury Racecourse and Plymouth and people hoping to travel between the two should not try.

It also said there was a limited service running to and from the racecourse along other lines. GWR's head of communications, Dan Panes, said branch lines - the line to Henley for example - were running but difficulties outside of the Thames Valley were making onward travel more challenging. ""If you're trying to get to somewhere on [branch] lines that makes sense,but if you're trying to use those lines to, for example, get into London or further west say than Swindon, we're just not going to be able to get you there at the moment,"" he said.

'Problematic'

""We can run trains until that flood-water gets above the height of a rail, because at that point you've got the risk of the ballast that holds the track in place washing away."" ""Colleagues at Network Rail are doing their best [to] make it safe for trains to run again, but it is problematic now."" Across the UK, more than 150 flood warnings are in force. Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said Berkshire was not ""in such a serious position"" as some other parts of the UK. ""But there is a lot of water around, we do have a few properties underwater, low-lying land underwater, and that will continue at least today,"" she said. She added people needed to remain vigilant and keep across Environment Agency flood warnings later in the week, when more rain could fall. ""There's no space for that rainfall,"" she said, adding: ""That could lead to further flooding.""

The Cunning Man is slightly raised so avoided flooding despite its car park and beer garden being underwater

A Burghfield Bridge pub's car park and beer garden flooded early on Monday after the River Kennet burst its banks nearby. “I locked up last night and everything was fine but I had a feeling that something like this was going to happen pretty soon,"" the pub's assistant manager, Harrison May, said. “First thing this morning I got a text to say we were flooded but we are pretty fortunate that we are slightly raised so we can stay open even in situations like this because it does happen from time to time.”"

PA Media Drivers are being advised to be aware of surface water on the roads

Parts of Scotland are bracing for a second day of disruption with high winds and localised flooding after Storm Bert swept heavy snow and rain across the country. The central belt was hit by more snow than anticipated early on Saturday, causing widespread problems on the roads. The M8 saw long traffic jams and two of the main routes south - the M74 and A68 - were closed for a time due to accidents. Regional flood alerts have also been issued for parts of Dumfries and Galloway, west Borders, Central, Tayside, Aberdeenshire, Dundee and Angus regions. A yellow weather warning for wind in the Highlands and Argyll and Bute will come into place from 12:00.

Flood warnings urging people to ""act now"" are also in place for four areas including the Churchill Barriers in Orkney, Strath Oykel in Sutherland and at the Carse of Lennoch and Crieff in Tayside.

Reuters Traffic was diverted to the Forth Road Bridge from the Queensferry Crossing

In an unusual move, the Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth was closed due to the threat of falling ice on Saturday. Traffic in the area was diverted via the Forth Road Bridge. The diversion remained in place until 01:00 on Sunday. David Bishop from the national road maintenance body Bear Scotland said the closure was due to concerns that ice sticking to the bridge's 70km of cable stays could fall and cause a ""significant road traffic incident"". It is the first time since 2021 the bridge has closed. All 700 buses in the Lothian Buses fleet ground to a halt for much of Saturday due to tough road conditions. The company announced services were back to normal early on Saturday evening. Edinburgh sightseeing buses were cancelled and there was disruption on Citylink, McGill's and First services. A dramatic image shared on social media showed a bus which had left the road at Buchlyvie, a village in the Stirling area.

George Henry, head of road safety and road policy for Transport Scotland, said the conditions had been ""challenging"". He said: ""We have been treating our roads around the clock, our operating companies have been out and we have used over 240 gritters. ""Unfortunately there has been some impacts with various vehicles being stuck due to some vehicles losing traction at various location and we’ve tried to treat that as quickly as we can to minimise the disruption to the motoring public.""

Risk of flooding

Mr Henry said particular incidents had impacted the M8 near Livingston and the M74 at various points on Saturday. He added attention is now turning to the risk of localised flooding caused by the temperature rising and snow melting. ""There will be lots of surface water so we urge the motoring public when they are returning to the roads to please take care and drive to the conditions they are faced with,"" he added.

Storm Bert brings rain and high winds on Sunday

A total of 11 SPFL games were called off with kick-off times delayed on another three, including two in the Premiership. One of those called off was a league two match between Cove Rangers and Stenhousemuir, after the away team's bus got stuck in snow at Broxden Services outside Perth. Over 3,000 homes in England and Wales are without power. Scotland has not been hit as hard, with both Scottish Power and SSE reporting just a few localised faults. The Met Office has warned a rapid thaw and subsequent rain may cause further disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain and snow remained in place for most of Scotland until 09:00 on Sunday. The Highlands and Argyll and Bute will see winds of up to 65mph on Sunday, with a yellow warning in place from 12:00 until 00:00. Forecasters say Storm Bert will be quite slow moving and will only start to clear from Monday."

Sienna Anderson Freshwater Bay in West Wight experienced very high winds

Emergency services in the south of England have urged people to stay indoors as Storm Bert swept the country. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service (OFRS) said on Sunday evening it was experiencing very high levels of calls for people in vehicles stuck in flood waters and properties flooding. Yellow wind and rain warnings are in place across the region, with dozens of weekend events cancelled because of the weather conditions. A man died in Hampshire after a tree fell on a car on the A34, though officers have not said if the incident was linked to the storm.

'Take action'

Multiple flood warnings have been issued throughout the south. ""Most of our crews are out working hard to assist those in most need prioritising life risk calls,"" OFRS posted on Facebook. ""Now is the time to take action if you are potentially facing flooding."" ""We urge you to not travel unless it is absolutely essential,"" it said. Thames Valley Police said it had received a number of reports of flooding in Oxfordshire, including Cherwell, West Oxfordshire, South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse. Hailey Road through to Crawley Road in Witney was closed due to flooding on Sunday evening, the force added. Wind gusts of 74.9mph (127.7km/h) were recorded at the Needles, off the Isle of Wight. They were the second highest in the UK after the 82mph recorded in the Welsh village of Capel Curig.

Great Western Railway services between Reading and Basingstoke were impacted by the severe weather. Southwestern Railway services into London Waterloo were also disrupted by a tree blocking the railway between Fleet and Farnborough, in Hampshire. Sunday was exceptionally mild for November, the Met Office said, with a high of 17.8C (64F) recorded in Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, before 10:00 GMT

'Significant damage'

Weekend closures include Harold Hillier Arboretum and Gardens in Hampshire and Moors Valley Country Park in Dorset. And organisers of Wokingham's Winter Carnival said the event would not go ahead. ""The high winds being forecast for this Sunday would not allow us to put up the stage, operate the fairground and would be dangerous for our stallholders,"" they said.

On Saturday Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, closed the light trial around its landscaped gardens, the Christmas market, and the ice rink that it introduced for the first time last week. The attractions remain closed until 14:00 on Sunday. Banbury Victorian Christmas Market was cancelled after stalls were blown over during the night. ""Despite our best efforts to secure the stalls overnight, the intensity of the winds has caused significant damage, making it unsafe for our team, traders, and visitors to continue with the event,"" organisers said.

Banbury Town Council said its Christmas lights switch on event was called off due to ""weather conditions and safety concerns"". But it said the ""newly designed Christmas lights scheme can be enjoyed from tonight and throughout the festive season"". Cotswold Wildlife Park said only people with pre-purchased tickets and season tickets would be granted access on Sunday. Other visitors were asked to postpone their visits “until conditions improve”. Hundreds of homes in south Oxfordshire were without power overnight, mainly those with RG9 postcodes.

Network Rail A tree blocked the railway line between Reading and Basingstoke, at Bramley

In Reading, the planned installation of a new pedestrian and cycle bridge on the A33 Relief Road has has been postponed. Resurfacing work had also been planned. It means the A33 Relief Road, which was due to shut during the works, will be open as usual. South Western Railway said trains would be running at reduced speed on all lines, meaning possible delays and disruptions until midday on Monday. Services between Exeter and London Waterloo will start and finish at Basingstoke. All services are starting later than usual on Sunday and Monday because of safety checks. Disruption to the train operator's services was also caused by trees blocking the lines between Reading and Basingstoke, as well as Woking and Farnborough Main. ""Trains were able to be cautioned through the area until our teams were able to get to the site and remove the branches,"" a Network Rail spokesperson said."

Dive Brief:

Target endured higher than expected supply chain costs in Q3, partially contributing to its disappointing financial performance during the quarter, Chair and CEO Brian Cornell said on a Nov. 20 earnings call.

The big box retailer experienced 90 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain expenses in the quarter, leading to a 20-basis point reduction in gross margin rate year over year, CFO Jim Lee told analysts.

“While we weren't pleased with this cost pressure, we are confident we took the right steps to safeguard our reliability as our team's decisive actions protected Q3 in stocks while supporting our Q4 merchandising plans,” Cornell said.

Dive Insight:

Target said it faced unique challenges in its supply chain due to the strike at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports in October, as well as volatility in receipt timing at some ports in Asia, executives told analysts during the earnings call.

The retailer was proactive in mitigating the impact of a three-day strike from the International Longshoremen’s Association by routing select shipments to West Coast ports ahead of the busy holiday season, COO Michael Fiddelke said on the call. But the strategy “came at a cost” as the company reported a 3% YoY increase in inventory during the quarter.

“Thankfully, the strike was short-lived,” Fiddelke added. “We'll continue to watch the situation closely in the lead up to continued negotiations in January.”

The impact of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton also added turbulence to the retailer’s operations.

In the case of the storms, Target closed some supply chain facilities in the affected regions ahead of time but reopened them within 24 hours, per Fiddelke.

Despite softer Q3 sales, there were some bright spots. The retailer cut its average shipping time across its network by a day compared to last year in Q3 thanks to its growing sortation center network, Fiddelke.

“We've also implemented changes to reduce split shipments, driving an increase in units fulfilled per package, eliminating a source of friction for our guests and reducing last-mile delivery costs as well,” Fiddelke said.

Target’s 11 sortation centers — a centerpiece of its holiday fulfillment strategy — handled 25% more packages year over year during Q3.

“Altogether, our sortation centers have saved the company tens of millions of dollars in last-mile delivery costs so far this year when compared to other fulfillment options,” Fiddelke said."

Snow has led to a day of disruption in Devon, with some roads closed, more than 130 schools shut and thousands of homes without power. Falling temperatures are expected to bring icy patches on the roads and police have warned drivers to only venture out if ""absolutely necessary"". Snow fell around the region up to 7.8in (20cm) deep on Dartmoor according to forecasters, who said more fell than predicted. Traffic ground to a halt on several roads with a warning from police about abandoned cars.

Watch: Snowy scenes as cold snap hits UK

Freezing temperatures and snowfall continued across parts of the UK on Wednesday morning after weather warnings covered all four nations. Yellow warnings for ice and snow were prompted by the first snowfall of the season, which caused more than 200 schools to close on Tuesday. New warnings were announced for parts of the UK going into Thursday and the weekend. Icy conditions led to warnings vehicles could be stranded, power cuts may occur and rural areas could be cut off. National Rail advised passengers to check their journey before travelling.

Temperatures widely dropped to between -1C (30.2F) and -4C (24.8F) across the UK on Wednesday morning, getting as low as -7.8C the Grampians, Scotland, and -7C in Shap, Cumbria. Further heavy snow fell in northern Scotland overnight, while north Wales and the midlands also woke up to fresh snow on the ground. Yellow weather warnings were in place for parts of all UK nations early on Wednesday, signalling likely disruption to travel and a danger of slips and falls on icy ground. A new warning for ice will kick in at 16:00 for most of Scotland as well as much of mid and north Wales, Northern Ireland, the West Midlands, the north of England and Northern Ireland. This will last until 10:00 on Thursday. Parts of northern Scotland and its west coast are covered by snow and ice warnings until 12:00 on Thursday.

PA Media North Yorkshire is one of the areas impacted by travel disruption

Meanwhile, a yellow warning for snow will come into force in much of South West England at 05:00 on Thursday, lasting until 15:00. In pictures: Chilly scenes across the South West On Wednesday, nearly 100 schools and nurseries were shut in Scotland as well as almost 50 in Wales and at least 30 in England due to frosty conditions. Commuters were advised to plan ahead and take extra care while driving. In Cornwall, a person was taken to hospital after a four-vehicle crash in icy conditions, police said. Elsewhere in Aberdeenshire, a bus ended up on its side in icy road conditions in the New Leeds area on Tuesday. There were no injuries. The RAC said it had seen a sharp rise in breakdowns, mostly due to people's batteries failing in the cold. It urged drivers to travel prepared for a breakdown. ""A blanket, warm waterproof coat and gloves, sturdy footwear and a charging cable and mobile power bank are all essentials,"" said spokeswoman Alice Simpson. Transport for Wales said 13% of its rail services had been disrupted by severe weather, while crashes were reported on snowy roads. In north Wales, trains were suspended between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog until about 07:30 on Wednesday, while a road in Wrexham was blocked by a lorry stuck in snow. Northern Ireland avoided the worst of the snow, but Translink warned of disruption to some services in the Magherafelt and Cookstown areas, including school routes, due to road conditions. ScotRail said it was struggling to source rail replacement transport due to the weather, after a fallen tree caused disruption to some services in and out of Aberdeen - but tickets were valid on existing Stagecoach North services. A raft of services were disrupted on the Merseyrail train network, while road disruptions were reported in parts of North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire Police earlier reported the A169 Sleights to Whitby, A171 Fylingdales, A171 north of Whitby and A174 Whitby towards Guisborough were all impassable, but have said the roads were open and ""passable with care"" on Wednesday afternoon.

144,2024-11-18 00:00:00,"Two undersea cables in Baltic Sea disrupted, sparking warnings of possible ‘hybrid warfare’","CNN —

Two undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea have been suddenly disrupted, according to local telecommunications companies, amid fresh warnings of possible Russian interference with global undersea infrastructure.

A communications cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday morning around 10:00 a.m. local time, a spokesperson from telecommunications company Telia Lithuania confirmed to CNN.

The company’s monitoring systems could tell there was a cut due to the traffic disruption, and that the cause was likely physical damage to the cable itself, Telia Lithuania spokesperson Audrius Stasiulaitis told CNN. “We can confirm that the internet traffic disruption was not caused by equipment failure but by physical damage to the fiber optic cable.”

Another cable linking Finland and Germany was also disrupted, according to Cinia, the state-controlled Finnish company that runs the link. The C-Lion cable – the only direct connection of its kind between Finland and Central Europe – spans nearly 1,200 kilometers (730 miles), alongside other key pieces of infrastructure, including gas pipelines and power cables.

The incidents came as two of the affected countries, Sweden and Finland, updated their guidance to citizens on how to survive war. Millions of households in the Nordic nations will be given booklets with instructions on how to prepare for the effects of military conflicts, communications outages and power cuts.

Both countries joined NATO in the past two years, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The area that was disrupted along the Finnish-German cable is roughly 60 to 65 miles away from the Lithuanian-Swedish cable that was cut, a CNN analysis of the undersea routes shows.

It is unclear what exactly caused the fault in the C-Lion cable – Cinia said in a statement that it is still investigating the issue. A physical inspection has not yet been conducted, Reuters reported citing the company’s chief executive Ari-Jussi Knaapila, who told a press conference on Monday that the sudden outage implied that the cable was cut by an outside force.

The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement on Monday evening that they were “deeply concerned” about the severed C-Lion cable, and raised the possibility of “hybrid warfare.”

“The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway,” the statement said. “Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.”

Fears of undersea sabotage

The United States recently warned that it had detected increased Russian military activity around key undersea cables. Two US officials told CNN in September that the US believed Russia was now more likely to carry out potential sabotage operations on these critical pieces of infrastructure.

The warning followed a joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, which reported in April 2023 that Russia had a fleet of suspected spy ships operating in Nordic waters as part of a program of potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region.

However, two US officials familiar with an initial assessment into the damage to the two cables told CNN Tuesday that as yet there were “no indications of nefarious activity, nor intentional damage to seafloor infrastructure” and suggested the disruption was likely caused by an anchor dragged from a passing vessel.

Ship tracking data analyzed by CNN shows at least one ship crossing the Lithuania-Sweden cable.

The extent of the disruption caused by Cinia’s C-Lion fault revealed Monday is unclear. The most important data flows are usually routed through several different cables, to avoid overreliance on a single link.

A repair vessel is ready to go to the site of the fault, Cinia said in a statement Monday evening. It said it did not know how long repairs would take, but added it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables.

Lithuanian state media was first to report the cut between Lithuania and Sweden, and quoted Telia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius saying that the cable handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. Capacity has been restored since the disruption.

The cable is operated by Arelion, a Swedish telecommunications company. Martin Sjögren, a spokesperson for the company, confirmed the damage to the BCS East-West link and said that the company is in contact with Sweden’s military and civil authorities about the incident. The cable had connected Gotland, Sweden and Šventoji, Lithuania, he said.

The issue was detected on Sunday during routine 24/7 monitoring of the company’s network, and the cable is expected to be repaired over the next few weeks, depending on weather conditions, he added.

Cinia did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for further details. CNN has reached out to the Swedish and Lithuanian foreign ministries for comment.

146,2024-11-16 00:00:00,Elon Musk wants Trump to disrupt Wall Street with Treasury pick,"CNN —

As Donald Trump privately considers his team to lead America’s economy during his term, Elon Musk has put his thumb on the scale, urging followers on X to help make a public push for a candidate who won’t be “business as usual” on Wall Street.

Musk, a Trump ally who has gained significant influence in the formation of Trump’s incoming administration, posted on X Saturday that he wants Howard Lutnick, a staunch Trump supporter who runs investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to serve as the next Treasury secretary.

Scott Bessent, the founder of capital management firm Key Square, has been widely viewed as the frontrunner for the job.

“My view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change,” Musk posted Saturday. “Business-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another.”

Musk urged his followers to “weigh in on this for @realDonaldTrump to consider feedback.”

Both Bessent and Lutnick are respected on Wall Street and have publicly supported Trump and his economic policies — including massive and unprecedented tariffs that remain largely unpopular among mainstream economists. Both also have embraced cryptocurrencies, which Trump has backed in recent months despite initial skepticism.

But Lutnick, a leader of Trump’s transition team, demonstrates a personality that is somewhat more forceful and boasting than Bessent, whose demeanor is perhaps more typical of a Treasury secretary — a position that often plays a calming role for Wall Street during times of economic or market turmoil.

For example, Bessent wrote an op-ed on Fox News on Friday in support of Trump’s policy, saying, “Tariffs are a means to finally stand up for Americans.” Lutnick, by contrast, spoke at Trump’s controversial pre-election Madison Square Garden rally, exclaiming: “When was America great? … 125 years ago. We had no income tax, and all we had was tariffs.”

That’s why some Wall Street titans are trying to push for Bessent. Kyle Bass, a billionaire hedge fund investor at Hayman Capital Management, said Lutnick doesn’t have the composition to lead the Treasury.

“Scott Bessent is eminently more qualified than Howard Lutnick to run the U.S. Treasury,” Bass posted on X Wednesday. “Scott understands markets, economics, people, and geopolitics better than anyone I’ve ever interacted with. Markets have already anticipated a Bessent choice. Lutnick is not Trump’s answer.”

Agreeing with Bass, Third Point’s Dan Loeb posted: “Right now the only thing that matters is the President’s choice for this important position,” noting the Treasury secretary will help determine how much America’s economy grows by giving investors confidence about inflation and markets.

But style aside, market analysts say Trump has made clear his intention to impose widespread tariffs, and the person occupying the Treasury secretary office probably won’t make much of a difference other than, perhaps, the speed at which they get enacted.

“The fact is that if Trump wants tariffs, he’s going to get tariffs regardless of who’s in charge at Treasury or USTR or anywhere else,” said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “There’s plenty of levers he can use, and I wouldn’t really expect a huge difference there.”

If Trump’s plans to impose across-the-board tariffs, deport millions of undocumented workers and potentially influence the Federal Reserve get put in place, the next Treasury secretary may need to contend with another inflation crisis. Those policies would weaken growth, boost inflation and lower employment, according to a recent working paper released by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Inflation would climb to at least 6% by 2026, and by 2028, consumer prices would be 20% higher, the researchers found.

Both Lutnick and Bessent have been skeptical of mainstream economists’ predictions that Trump’s policies would be inflationary.

Trump’s decision-making process

Treasury secretary contenders have spent the past week in behind-the-scenes maneuvering to secure the marquee economic role.

Late last week, Trump had reached a near-final decision to hand the role to Bessent, a relatively recent MAGA convert, a decision some officials involved in the transition began to message to outside allies. At that point, Lutnick waged an aggressive, eleventh-hour campaign to position himself for the job. Four people familiar with the dynamic tell CNN that Lutnick sought to convince Trump that only he would be in full support of the steep tariffs Trump had pledged — and which Lutnick had been promoting in cable television appearances.

As the competition intensified — with Bessent described as taking a more back-seat approach to Lutnick’s semi-public campaign — frustration grew palpable among Trump and his team.

“He’s following the Cheney model,” one person said of Lutnick — not favorably — referring to Dick Cheney’s job heading up George W. Bush’s vice-presidential selection committee before landing the job himself.

Trump even mused that he ought to rule out both of them and pick a neutral party: Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty had interviewed the prior weekend for a variety of administration jobs, and Larry Kudlow, a Trump loyalist, would be seen as a market- and tax-friendly pick.

But Kudlow, 77, informed the Trump team that he will not be returning to government, in part to preserve his health, according to sources familiar with the conversations. In June 2018, while serving as Trump’s director of the National Economic Council, Kudlow suffered a mild heart attack and was hospitalized. In addition to a leadership role at the America First Policy Institute, an outside group that has helped develop Trump’s agenda, he currently hosts a show on Fox Business where members of Trump’s orbit often appear to promote it.

A full week after appearing to decide on nominating Bessent, Trump interviewed him again at Mar-a-Lago.

What the Treasury secretary does

Regardless of party affiliation, Treasury secretaries historically have espoused policies that strengthen the US dollar, promote economic growth, signal stability to the stock and bond markets, and seek to maintain stability of the tax base, revenue from which flows into Treasury’s coffers to fund the operations of the federal government.

A key Cabinet player, the Treasury secretary advises the president on economic and fiscal matters, including spending and taxes.

The role will be especially important in the coming Trump administration considering the president-elect’s campaign promises to impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the United States, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.

Also, the incoming secretary will quickly have to deal with making sure the nation doesn’t default on its obligations once the debt ceiling returns in early January, unless Congress addresses the cap before that. Plus, the secretary will work with Trump and congressional Republicans to extend the more than $4 trillion in Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions that expire at the end of 2025.

And all that’s in addition to the secretary’s regular duties overseeing the Treasury Department, which pays trillions of dollars in bills, collects taxes, sells US debt securities to investors and serves as a regulator of the banking and finance industries. The secretary also serves as the nation’s finance minister on the global stage.

During his first term, Trump chose Steven Mnuchin, a financier and Hollywood producer who stayed in the administration all four years. Mnuchin, who had no government experience before taking the Treasury post, had also served as finance chairman of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. He worked on and helped implement the 2017 tax cuts law and some of the key pandemic relief measures, including the stimulus checks that were distributed to millions of Americans, among other initiatives."

Now Raneri is going back to the basics to build a new following, including traveling solo in a rented cargo van led by nothing more than a spirit of success through hard work.

""(Bayside) just made fans slowly but surely until big tours appeared and press wanted to talk to us. It's really the only way that I know how to do this,"" Raneri says. ""I'm from New York, and seeing how the country world works in Nashville, it's so alien to me.""

The process of recording his latest record revealed to Raneri that, in the country music space, upfront connections lead to successful gigs and fandom. Most rising country artists typically securing big deals before playing at local venues in Nashville.

Raneri says, ""When I was starting my career, no one would get a record deal who didn't have fans. Now labels, publicists and agents first want to see your social media following and what you're doing without them. And country is the opposite, but I don't know how to just sit and wait until someone calls with a great opportunity. I need to go out and do something.""

Working in different genres of music has given Raneri a unique perspective on the rise to stardom. Most rock bands, he says, first go on tours to open for big name artists, then they rise to headline themselves. There are small press opportunities one day, then cover stories the next. He describes Bayside as a ""working class band"" that is not famous but plays shows and sells merch to earn a living. In the pop music space, he says that attention is reserved for the biggest names while country sits in between.

""I have not been a new artist in over two decades,"" Raneri says. ""Most people know who I am, so I have to convince them that I can do something else. I think that I have always been doing something serious and real, but some people hear emo and they think they already know what I sound like.""

Raneri debuts his fresh sound with today's release of a solo EP, Everyday Royalty (Equal Vision Records). The new record features seven tracks of anthemic alt-rock that soul-searching indie-folk and full-tilt country fans crave. Creative freedom, intention and experience also combine in the debut single, ""Bones,"" a moody, hypnotic track with music video directed and produced by Wombat Fire.

“As a 20-year fan of Bayside, and specifically Anthony’s songwriting, I was excited that he was taking a creative step outside the band to put out solo music,"" says multi-Platinum songwriter Joey Hyde. ""To get to be a small part of that journey was something truly special.”

Now 25 years into his music career, Raneri is leading a U.S. solo tour with backup from artists Brother Bird and Nate Bergman. The 24-date tour includes performances in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and Las Vegas."

149,2024-11-15 00:00:00,Video: New Zealand MPs disrupt parliament with haka,"New Zealand MPs perform haka during hearing in protest of proposed bill





The New Zealand Parliament was suspended after Maori members staged a haka to disrupt the vote on a contentious bill to reinterpret an 184-year-old treaty between the British and Indigenous Maori. The controversial legislation is seen by many Maori and their supporters as undermining the rights of the country’s Indigenous people, who make up around 20% of the population of 5.3 million.





First signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Maori chiefs, the Treaty of Waitangi lays down how the two parties agreed to govern. The interpretation of clauses in the document still guides legislation and policy today. Rulings by the courts and a separate Maori tribunal have progressively expanded Maori rights and privileges over the decades. However, some argue this has discriminated against non-Indigenous citizens. The ACT New Zealand party, a junior partner in the ruling center-right coalition government, proposed a bill to enshrine a narrower interpretation of the Waitangi treaty in law."

Watch: Moment MP leads haka to disrupt New Zealand parliament

New Zealand's parliament was brought to a temporary halt by MPs performing a haka, amid anger over a controversial bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding treaty with Māori people. Opposition party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional ceremonial group dance after being asked whether her party supported the bill, which faced its first vote on Thursday. Meanwhile, a hīkoi - or peaceful protest march - organised by a Māori rights group, is continuing to make its way towards the capital, Wellington. Thousands have already joined the nine-day march against the bill, which reached Auckland on Wednesday, having begun in the far north of New Zealand on Monday.

The country is often considered a leader in indigenous rights, but opponents of the bill fear those same rights are being put at risk by this bill. Act, the political party that introduced the bill, argues there is a need to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which has been fundamental to race relations in New Zealand. The core values of the treaty have, over time, been woven into New Zealand's laws in an effort to redress the wrong done to Māori during colonisation.

Danielle Moreau The protest march against the bill made its way through Auckland on Wednesday

But Act - a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition - say this has resulted in the country being divided by race, and the bill will allow the treaty to be interpreted more fairly through parliament, rather than the courts. The party's leader, David Seymour, has dismissed opponents as wanting to ""stir up"" fear and division. Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling of much-needed support for many Māori. The first reading passed on Thursday after a 30-minute break, backed by all parties from the ruling coalition. Maipi-Clarke was suspended from the house. It is unlikely to pass a second reading, as Act's coalition partners have indicated they will not support it. But this has not placated those worried about the bill, and its impact, with the hikoi still making progress along its 1,000km (621-mile) route.

Danielle Moreau Danielle Moreau (centre) took part in the march as it passed through Auckland with her sons Bobby and Teddy

In Auckland, it took an estimated 5,000 marchers two hours to cross the harbour bridge. Officials had closed two lanes, the New Zealand Herald reported, to allow them to continue along the route. Danielle Moreau, who is Māori, walked over the Harbour Bridge with her two sons, Bobby and Teddy, and told the BBC she ""was hoping it [the hīkoi] would be big but it was much more epic than I expected"". ""I marched to make the point that Te Tiriti [the Treaty of Waitangi] is very important to our national identity,"" said Winston Pond, who also took part in the march on Wednesday. ""We are a multi-cultural society built on a bicultural base - something that cannot be altered.""

Juliet Tainui-Hernández, from the Māori tribe Ngāi Tahu, and her Puerto Rican partner Javier Hernández, brought their daughter Paloma to the hīkoi. Ms Tainui-Hernández said those who turned out in support did so ""for the respectful and inclusive nation we want Aotearoa [New Zealand] to be for our tamariki mokopuna - our children and grandchildren"". Kiriana O’Connell, who is also Māori, said that the current treaty principles were already a compromise for her people, and she would not support a ""rewrite"". Under the proposed legislation, the treaty principles that would be defined in law are: that the government has a right to govern and that parliament has the full right to make laws

that the rights of Māori are respected by the Crown

that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to equal protection under it. Act leader Seymour - who is also New Zealand's associate justice minister - argues that because the principles have never been properly defined legally, the courts ""have been able to develop principles that have been used to justify actions that are contrary to the principle of equal rights"". He says these include ""ethnic quotas in public institutions"" that go against the spirit of fairness for all New Zealanders. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, however, has called the bill ""divisive"" - despite being part of the same coalition.

152,2024-11-12 00:00:00,How To Manage Your Time When Shifting Priorities Disrupt Your Day,"African American woman text messaging at her desk. getty

Picture this: you open your inbox Monday morning to find it flooded with 100 new emails despite clearing everything up over the weekend. We begin each day with solid intentions to tackle significant tasks, but a flood of urgent communications and shifting priorities often takes over. Sound familiar?

Unexpected and Constant interruptions—from urgent emails to last-minute requests—can quickly derail your plans. How can you manage your time effectively in the face of these relentless distractions?

The key lies not in eliminating these interruptions—yes, work on reducing them, but eliminating them could be nearly impossible—but in creating a structure that can absorb them without overwhelming your schedule. This approach reduces task-switching and helps maintain focus, allowing you to address new requests during dedicated times.

Here are several strategies to help you manage your time and maintain productivity amid constant new tasks and unforeseen changes.

1. Build Buffer Times Between Meetings

When your day is packed back-to-back, even a slight delay can escalate into stress. Incorporate buffer times of at least 10 to 15 minutes between meetings to accommodate unexpected disruptions and new tasks. These short breaks allow you to handle urgent items or last-minute requests without compromising workflow. It also enhances the quality of your next meeting, as you can prepare and focus better after a brief pause.

To create a 15-minute buffer between meetings, you have three simple options:

Automatic Buffer Settings: Many calendar tools have settings allowing you to add breaks between meetings automatically. The calendar will prevent back-to-back bookings by activating this feature, ensuring a 15-minute gap. This helps create space to wrap up notes, grab a break, or mentally transition before the next meeting. Scheduling Shorter Meetings: Instead of scheduling full 60-minute meetings, you can set them to end at 45 minutes. This approach maintains a 15-minute buffer and encourages a more efficient, focused meeting format. Blocking your calendar: When you plan your day the night before and see a packed schedule, you can proactively block (set as ""busy"") any remaining open spaces to prevent last-minute meetings from creeping in. This strategy allows you to reserve time for focused work, task completion, or necessary breaks, ensuring that your day isn’t entirely consumed by meetings.

2. Create ‘Admin Work Blocks’ for Managing New Tasks

To combat the nagging feeling that you have to do admin tasks (but you don't want to), schedule specific blocks of time for administrative work. The goal is to alleviate the mental burden of continuous interruptions and reduce time fragmentation. Setting aside 60 to 90 minutes daily can help you batch-process communications and tackle incoming tasks rather than reacting to them throughout the day.

You can do the same with email management, setting ""check email"" time to prevent checking emails continuously and avoid distractions and switching costs.

3. Use Time Blocks Like DNA to Prevent Overwhelm

Consider your schedule as a strand of DNA; not every part needs to be filled with tasks. Just as certain sections in DNA act as buffers to prevent genetic errors (According to current scientific understanding, approximately 98-99% of DNA does not contain genes, meaning it is considered ""non-coding"" DNA), you should reserve ""blank"" or open blocks of time for handling last-minute requests and changes in priorities.

This strategy helps you avoid feeling overwhelmed, creating room for flexibility to adapt when urgent tasks arise. By leaving gaps in your schedule, you equip yourself to pivot without disrupting your entire day.

4. Categorize Shifting Priorities by Urgency and Importance

Not every incoming request demands immediate attention. As new tasks and interruptions come your way, employ a quick mental filter: Is this task truly urgent and important? If it’s both, address it right away; otherwise, schedule it for your designated admin block.

5. Protect Focus Time for Deep Work

While handling urgent tasks is essential, protecting dedicated time for deep work is equally crucial. Block out at least one to two hours each day for uninterrupted focus, where you can dive into your most important projects or complex tasks that require deep concentration. Silence your email notifications and eliminate other distractions during this time.

Focus time is essential for addressing complex tasks requiring creativity and problem-solving, enabling you to make substantial progress despite frequent interruptions and filling your day with motivation.

6. Review and Adjust Your Daily Schedule

Finally, set aside time at the end of each day to review your schedule for the following day. If you’re not in the habit of planning your day the night before, I highly recommend giving it a try. Developing a routine for daily planning can help you get ahead of tasks and reduce next-day stress. Consider using AI tools or time management apps to make it easier to establish this habit—these tools can help you set clear goals, schedule blocks of focused work, and keep interruptions to a minimum.

By incorporating buffer times, scheduling blocks for admin work, and designing DNA-like gaps in your calendar, you can be more flexible and be able to manage your time when shifting priorities and interruptions kick in. The goal is not to control every moment of your day but to create a structure that supports productivity amid the chaos. By managing your time with intention, you can reduce stress and enhance your overall efficiency, even on the busiest days."
153,2024-11-08 00:00:00,Canada’s West Coast Port Strike Causes Supply Chain Panic,"The West Coast ports handle about $576 million in daily trade and play a vital role in North America’s interconnected ports, railways, and trucking. However, a prolonged strike could throw a wrench in this well-oiled machine, causing ripple effects throughout the entire supply chain. getty

The holiday season is fast approaching. But this year’s excitement could be dampened by the threat of major trade disruptions due to ongoing port strikes, once again.

British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (BCMEA) locked out over 700 foremen at ports across British Columbia. This disruption coincides with an ongoing strike at the Port of Montreal - the largest port in eastern Canada - which has been already facing partial closures affecting 40% of its container traffic.

It’s not hard to see how shipping backlogs could pile up, which could potentially disrupt the important international shipments, causing serious economic headaches for businesses and consumers.

The ripple effect of the strike

The West Coast ports are a powerhouse, handling about $576 million in daily trade and playing a vital role in North America’s network of ports, railways, and trucking. However, a prolonged strike could throw a wrench in this well-oiled machine, causing ripple effects throughout the entire supply chain.

History serves as a reminder: Last month, a three-day strike involving over 47,000 dockworkers affected 36 U.S. ports, and while it was brief, the resulting backlog of ships waiting to unload cargo is expected to disrupt local and international supply chains for weeks.

Forbes Drug Shortages Create Surprising Opportunity For Pharma Supply Chain

With cargo activities already affected, vital international shipments are at risk, which could lead to significant economic losses for various industries. This situation may worsen shipping backlogs and bottlenecks for businesses, driving up transportation costs and potentially leading to shutdowns of plants and mills that depend on shipping to get their products out the door.

It’s not just the big players who will feel the heat. The small and medium-sized businesses are likely to be hit hardest due to lack of flexibility in contracts comparing to larger companies, making them more vulnerable to increased costs and delays when shipment plans change.

For distributors serving multiple retailers, even a small delay can mean they can’t meet their contractual obligations, which could lead to penalties.

While consumers might not notice immediate shortages on grocery shelves or in stores, if this labor dispute drags on for weeks, they may soon feel the impact as costs rise and availability dips.

Supply chain strategies behind fully stocked shelves

As this is not the first nor the last supply chain disruption, leveraging supply chain best practices is essential for effectively navigating these challenges. Here are what companies can do in a long and in a short time:

Enhancing visibility is essential for making informed and agile decisions. Rising costs linked to backlog are just one concern; unforeseen incidents can also occur. Because who would imagine a lithium-ion battery caused a fire after an overturned tractor trailer, which burned for several days and temporarily closed the ports? But with enhanced visibility companies can make quick and informed decisions to mitigate the impact of such unexpected events.

Forbes Digital Supply Chains: Bridging The Gap Between Vision And Reality

By integrating scenario planning, organizations can develop tailored strategic responses for various scenarios by analyzing historical data on strikes and other disruptions to understand their potential causes.

Re-routing and alternative shipping methods are widely used strategy. During US port strike in October, the Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd implemented local port surcharges for cargo moving to and from affected terminals. Some shipping lines began rerouting vessels to alternative ports, which resulted in longer transit times and additional shipping costs – but at least no disappointed customers. Instead of only using ocen freight, shifting to air cargo were it is feasable is a quick solution.

Cross-functional and clear communication is crucial in times of uncertainty because no business can do it alone. Providing regular updates about potential delays can help manage expectations and maintain customer relationships. Clear communication is crucial in times of uncertainty, ensuring that both suppliers and customers are informed about the situation. After all, who wants to see their order stuck in the same status for two weeks without any updates?

Inventory optimization strategies help buffer against supply chain interruptions by determining optimal stock levels for essential parts and products. By leveraging advanced and AI-driven demand forecasting tools, companies can better predict consumer needs and strategically position inventory closer to customers – so even if primary distribution channels are disrupted, businesses can fulfill orders quickly.

Behind those fully stocked shelves lies a network of well-balanced long- and short-term strategies that make it all possible. By taking proactive steps to mitigate the impact of strikes and such events, businesses can not only protect their interests but also contribute to a more stable and resilient supply chain ecosystem.

154,2024-11-07 00:00:00,The Biggest Challenges Companies Face In 2025: Exclusive C-Suite And Middle Manager Survey,"Which challenges do business leaders expect in 2025? Technology shifts and political disruption top ... [+] the list. getty

“What to watch” was the most googled question in 2024. So I asked business leaders a similar question: What trends do we need to watch during the year ahead? Keeping up with the shifting landscape is vital for strategists, as their ideas do not exist in a vacuum.

I reached out to my Warwick Business School network of both C-suite executives and middle managers to discover the challenges that top their agenda. The former matter make the big decisions, the latter need to implement them. Both will play a vital role in helping companies to respond effectively to the challenges that will define 2025. Of the 232 responses, half were from senior executives and half from middle managers and specialist staff. Three graphs summarize the most interesting insights from the survey.

How have the challenges facing business changed?

Donald Trump just won the US election, a wider war in the Middle East is not off the table, and the Ukraine continues to fight Russia. So it comes as no great surprise that political disruption is high up the list – a considerable jump compared to last year.

However, the number one challenge remains the need to adjust to technology shifts. This issue rose to the top of corporate agendas last year when the generative AI hype was in full bloom.

Results from a survey where managers and executives identified major external factors they expect to ... [+] have an impact on their business Christian Stadler

Companies recognize that there is a substantial shift in terms of technology but there is also a growing frustration that AI is not delivering what the initial hype promised. This is common for new technologies. The real benefits will only come with specific applications and the adjustment of business processes. It is the latter part where executives can make a real difference. Creating the space—maybe even forcing—their teams to experiment will help to create new ways of working integrating AI in an effective manner.

As far as political disruption is concerned, companies need to invest considerable time and money into lobbying. The assumption that markets are rational has always been wrong, but that has probably become more obvious recently. And taking a stand on sensitive issues will often be unavoidable. The good news: if a company comes across as authentic it usually does not hurt sales. For example, Nike is known for its progressive views and the Chick-fil-A has strong conservative roots. A far bigger problem is if you are flip-flopping.

The anticipated lower inflation will make it easier to invest in initiatives tackling these two challenges. And there is one less obvious implication. Supply chain disruption, climate change, and social justice are considered to be the least important factors in 2025. As strategy is all about finding anomalies that others don’t see, there might be overlooked opportunities in this space.

Middle managers and c-suite executives have different priorities

While the top challenge has changed since the survey was first initiated three years ago, the one constant has been that c-suite executives and middle managers have different priorities. This year middle managers see technology shift as the top trend and political disruption as number two. For executives the order is reversed.

Middle managers expect technology to have a bigger impact than political disruption. For executives ... [+] it is the other way round. Christian Stadler

That difference matters as decisions made at the top can fall on deaf ears if they do not resonate with the operational front end. This year the issue is less pronounced than last year when worries about inflation and technology shifts pointed in considerably different directions. The former towards cost cutting the latter towards investment.

There is also an obvious solution: involve important stakeholders—and that includes middle managers—in important decisions. That does not mean there will be a vote at the end, but it should entail a smart consultation process. In settings where juniors don’t speak up when seniors are present, this might best be done in separate engagements by a neutral outsider. In essence this is a call for open strategy.

Regional differences

The third graph puts a spotlight on regional differences. Political disruption is expected to be the main challenge in North America and Africa. In Europe, the Middle East and Australia it is technology disruption. In Asia technology and political disruption share the number one spot. There were not enough responses from South America.

An interesting picture emerges when examining how different regions prioritised the various issues they faced. Combining the data from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and South America political disruption and rising inflation are seen as a more important trends than in the West. In Europe, North America, and Australia labor shortage, technology disruption, and climate change are seen as bigger challenges than in non-western countries.

The trends affecting companies vary by region, with political disruption and inflation having a ... [+] bigger impact in emerging economies while labor shortage is more of a concern in Western countries. Christian Stadler

Getting ready for 2025

The survey leaves little doubt that political disruption—which is particularly hard to manage—requires the attention of top managers. For those who possess the necessary political acumen, the tough environment offers opportunities to forge a path others cannot."
155,NaN,"Ferry disruption: Islanders face a 'difficult' winter, says transport minister","Islanders face a difficult winter, warns minister

BBC Fiona Hyslop said the ferry network faced a difficult and challenging winter

Islanders are facing a ""challenging and difficult"" winter because of potential disruption to ferry services, Scotland's transport minister has warned. Fiona Hyslop said Caledonian MacBrayne was under intense pressure because of a lack of available vessels - but that she was pushing the ferry operator to consider ""all options"" to maintain lifeline services. She was responding to an urgent question from one of her own backbenchers after it emerged the main Arran ferry MV Caledonian Isles may be out of action all winter. Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene accused the SNP of having a ""brass neck"" for blaming CalMac for problems it had created through years of underinvestment.

Hyslop told MSPs the latest delay to the return of Caledonian Isles - which has been out of action since January - was ""deeply frustrating and concerning"". ""Ministers and officials continue to push CalMac to ensure all options to expedite repairs are being considered,"" she said. She said CalMac was now looking at what it meant in terms of vessel redeployment across the entire west coast ferry network.

Christopher Brindle New problems with MV Caledonian Isles were found when it went into dry dock at Greenock

She said three options had been shared with island communities before route changes are announced next week. But CalMac had to balance the importance of the busy Arran route with the need to maintain lifeline services elsewhere, she added. ""That's the difficult balancing act in what is going to be a challenging and difficult winter,"" she said. ""We thought that last winter would be the period that would have caused most issue, and we should have seen at least the Glen Sannox vessel in by now.""

'Out of options'

Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene accused the SNP of having a ""brass neck"", saying the government was ultimately to blame for the problems, rather than CalMac. ""Let me tell you where the failures lie in this entire ferry scandal - it's right there on the SNP front benches,"" he said. ""That is the reason - the lack of investment, the lack of progress in new vessels. I haven't heard a single solution from the minister today on what CalMac is going to do to address this situation. ""They are completely out of vessels and they are completely out of options."" Hyslop said that was untrue, and that CalMac still had options to maintain services.

Christopher Brindle MV Caledonian Isles has been out of action since it went for annual maintenance in January

The west coast ferry operator is facing a perfect storm of problems as it tries to plan a winter schedule without two of the 10 major vessels it normally relies on. MV Caledonian Isles has been out of action since serious corrosion was discovered during annual maintenance in January, which required the removal of all its engines while repair work was carried out The 31-year-old ship returned from the Cammell Laird shipyard in Merseyside last month, but before it could carry passengers again, a new gearbox fault was detected which required several more weeks to fix. On Tuesday, CalMac revealed more problems had been discovered which could put the ship out of action until late March. Another large ferry, Hebridean Isles, will be retired later this month because it is no longer considered feasible to get it through its mandatory five-year survey. The long-delayed Arran ferry Glen Sannox, being built at the Ferguson shipyard, is three weeks past its latest delivery date.

Stephen Lipton A new ferry Glen Sannox, pictured during its final sea trials, will serve the Arran route but a final delivery date is still awaited

Once delivered, CalMac will need six-and-a-half weeks of crew familiarisation trials plus an already-booked annual overhaul in December before it becomes operational. Several other vessels will have to be withdrawn from service for their scheduled winter maintenance work in the coming months. The arrival of the first of four new large ferries being built in Turkey has also been delayed until March next year. A plan to charter an extra large vessel, MV Ben-My-Chree, from the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company foundered last week when it was established the ship would be unable to berth safely at Brodick harbour on Arran in poor weather.

getty

A commercial move is a complex endeavor that demands an extremely high level of efficiency. Even the slightest misstep can have a huge ripple effect, impacting a company’s ability to serve and support its customers. Every minute of unanticipated downtime resulting from issues that evolve during a move can translate to lost income and reputational damage.

As a software development professional with nearly two decades of experience in enterprise solutions and mobile app development, I have applied my practical and results-oriented approach to business to create personalized logistics and delivery services utilizing AI to optimize routes and provide businesses with the fastest, most efficient last-mile delivery resource possible. I've found that utilizing a blend of technology, transparency and data-driven expertise can help commercial moving companies achieve maximum efficiency.

It's critical to understand the stakes and know what it takes to streamline the process and avoid unexpected costs and delays. By developing a comprehensive and dynamic moving strategy that considers every unique factor, you can better prepare so that you leave nothing to chance.

The Challenges Of Commercial Moving

The primary challenge commercial movers must overcome is the proper and efficient handling of bulky items. To maximize efficiency, movers must be experienced with best practices for transporting items in and out of buildings and vehicles. In addition to being bulky, commercial items can often be fragile. Office equipment can include servers, printers, computers and other items that require special handling.

Sequencing is another challenge that must be addressed in commercial moving. The more precise moving companies can be in their loading and unloading of office or industrial components, the more quickly they can be redeployed in their new locations. Experienced commercial movers orchestrate moves in a way that ensures the right equipment is available at the right time.

When certain types of technology are involved in a move, coordination becomes another challenge that must be addressed. A successful commercial move often involves the efforts of professionals other than movers, such as those setting up servers, reassembling office furniture or connecting printers and other tech tools. To avoid delays, the moving company must keep those teams updated on the progress of the move.

The Role Of Technology In Modern Moving Solutions

Technology plays a huge role in the high levels of efficiency today’s commercial movers can achieve. Every step of the process—from determining fees to identifying routes to updating clients on progress—benefits from the use of modern technology solutions.

Flexibility and personalization are crucial benefits today’s technology brings to the world of commercial moving. Each move has its unique needs in terms of timelines, items that must be moved and challenges that must be overcome. Data-driven systems also empower transparent pricing to ensure costs are understood and approved before the move begins. This helps provide the details needed to make a fair comparison.

Harnessing The Power Of AI

Artificial intelligence is helping to empower greater levels of business efficiency in virtually every sector. In commercial moving, AI can help streamline inventory management, transport and communication.

By optimizing the movers' inventory management process, AI helps ensure companies have the resources available to meet client needs. This can include empowering demand forecasting, which draws upon economic indicators and other data to anticipate needs. As seen with companies like Microsoft, GE Digital and many others, AI can also drive intelligent packing, which involves gathering data from pictures of what needs to be moved to compile a list of materials that will be required.

Route optimization is another critical component of moving efficiency that benefits from AI, allowing companies like Amazon to offer same-day shipping for consumers. Analyzing data to determine the optimal route for transportation vehicles speeds up the move, reducing the time companies must be in transition. Route optimization also reduces fuel use and wear and tear on vehicles, which saves money for moving companies.

AI-driven systems enhance route optimization by providing dynamic updates to routing. If new data, such as changes to traffic or weather, impacts route efficiency, AI can automatically identify a new route and share it with transportation teams. Such real-time updates ensure travel efficiency is constantly optimized.

In addition to updating transport teams on modified routes, AI can also empower dynamic communication with clients. By providing real-time updates on the estimated time of arrival, companies can better ensure teams and other resources will be available and prepared to engage with movers once they reach their destination. Technology-enhanced communication systems can also support updates flowing from clients, letting movers know when access protocols are updated.

Stepping Into Modernized Commercial Moving

As companies seek to improve the efficiency of their moving operations by adopting the enhancements explored above, there are several steps they should take to evaluate their readiness. The first involves assessing whether or not they have the equipment and expertise needed to safely and strategically move today’s high-tech office equipment.

To leverage the power of AI for data analytics, companies need to have systems in place that bring all relevant data points together on one platform. Siloed systems prevent AI from conducting a comprehensive evaluation. Companies that want to conduct predictive analysis, such as demand forecasting, will need to give AI platforms access to historical data.

Optimizing user interfaces for both customers and employees is also an important step toward empowering efficient operations. Consumer-facing interfaces should provide transparency, flexibility and a high level of user control, enabling potential customers to explore a variety of options and providing the information needed to ensure moves are handled correctly. Employee-facing interfaces should make it easy for drivers and customer service representatives to receive and respond to notifications such as route updates or customer concerns.

Conclusion

For commercial moving, achieving maximum efficiency requires much more than transportation. Solutions should consider every aspect of the move, leveraging technology and informed strategies to empower a seamless transition. When approached strategically, the result is reduced downtime and the peace of mind that all equipment is transported with precision and moved in accordance with predetermined timelines.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 20: Firefighters work outside a building in Chinatown after four people ... [+] were killed by a fire in an e-bike repair shop overnight on June 20, 2023 in New York City. Lithium-ion e-bike batteries have caused numerous fires and fatalities in recent years due to the rising popularity of e-bikes for delivery purposes.

In a city that never sleeps, roughly 65,000 delivery workers travel upwards of 100 miles a day to supply New Yorkers with food and supplies. The use of e-bikes, cargo bikes, and mopeds has exploded since the pandemic and delivery workers rely on them for their livelihood.

However, the rise of light electric vehicles also comes with an alarming uptick in deadly fires sparked by unsafe lithium-ion batteries. The concerning escalation in aftermarket battery use and fire incidents result mainly from overuse and over-charging.

As they typically need to purchase their own vehicles, many delivery workers are forced to rely on cheaper, unlicensed third-party batteries which are often charged at home using knockoff chargers or old extension cords. These risks to themselves, their families and neighbours are further exacerbated by the density of urban living.

Smoke Signals For Safe Mobility Solutions

In 2022 alone, 220 fires were attributed to e-bike batteries in New York, up from just 44 incidents in 2020.

In 2023, 268 fires were caused by lithium-ion batteries, injuring 150 and killing 18 people including an apartment building in Harlem, where questionable batteries that were charging caught fire.

To ensure safe and accessible outdoor electric micromobility tailored to New York City, the DOT Studio, a collaborative innovation program run by the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) and Newlab, launched a call to tackle the problem. Their goal was to explore how technical solutions like battery swapping stations can address these issues. What began as a six-month pilot in 2023 has been extended through 2025 due to its success.

Delivery riders are often overlooked, despite being an essential part of the commerce industry. As independent contractors, they often lack the rights and protections of workers classified as employees – including health insurance, sick leave and compensation in case of injuries on the job. Exacerbated by a lack of workplace health and safety regulations, along with low pay and exposure to accidents, delivery workers are left disproportionately vulnerable to risks.

Piloting The Future Of Safe Delivery Working Conditions

So, the DOT Studio’s pilot solution was initiated to address the systemic challenges faced by delivery workers, including the safety and accessibility of battery charging methods – to minimize expenses, increase access to fully charged batteries during the workday and provide a safe alternative to charging at home.

The three startups chosen to participate in the pilot included Swobbee, Popwheels and Swiftmile. They tested their technologies across five locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn with ongoing feedback from 118 participating delivery workers. The solutions they explored include multi-modal battery swapping stations, open air battery charging cabinets, and secure charging bike racks, all designed to supply participants with safe and securely charged batteries.

In addition to the pilot, the city has created a new municipal Department of Sustainable Delivery in direct response to the rise in e-micromobility and its safety challenges, while supporting their expansion.

Battery Swapping: A Conversionary Strategy

Battery swapping stations offer a low-threshold solution to the problems posed by traditional e-bike charging methods. Instead of plugging in batteries and waiting for hours, delivery workers can now swap a depleted battery for a fully charged one in under a minute. And with their advanced software, the technology providers can guarantee the battery health and allow users to real-time manage the state of charge. This significantly reduces the risk of battery-related fires and reduces downtime, enabling workers to make more deliveries and travel longer distances.

With 118 active users (and over 700 on the waiting list) completing 12,000 battery swaps in the first 6 months of the project, the technology is already making an impact. At least 50% of users report they are no longer charging batteries at home. Notably, no fires have been reported at any of the certified charging points or with the batteries themselves.

Encouraged by these results, city officials have extended the pilot program until February 2025 and are actively working to install more battery swapping stations throughout the city, including on sidewalks. In addition, partners such as Swobbee and Popwheels plan to expand their cabinets to private properties such as parking lots.

The Wheels Of Bureaucracy Turn Slowly – But There Is Hope

Labour organizations representing delivery workers alongside city leaders supported the requirement to move battery charging outdoors. Despite this, charging stations have been slow to setup due to regulatory delays.

A proposed new rule from the city offers some good news, allowing battery cabinets to fall under ""revocable consent"". Once taking effect – likely in mid to late 2025 - local businesses including bodegas, grocery stores and restaurants could request to have battery cabinets installed outside of their doors. Opening the public right of way for battery swapping into the fabric of New York’s urban mobility infrastructure.

Moreover, in late 2023, local law 39 made New York the first city in the United States to ban the sale or lease of uncertified e-micromobility vehicles and batteries.

Hopeful steps towards making small battery-powered transportation safer and more accessible.

New York Pilot: A Blueprint For Cities Worldwide?

As the DOT Studio, Newlab and its partners are working to expand the number of swapping stations across the city, data from the first seven months of the pilot are providing insights into safety improvements, usage patterns, and economic benefits.

The pilot’s success in New York is not just a local win. The combination of smart regulations, technology and collaboration across a diverse partner ecosystem could offer a blueprint for cities worldwide grappling with the challenges of expanding a safe e-micromobility infrastructure.

161,2024-12-09 00:00:00,Descartes Releases December Global Shipping Report: November 2024 U.S. Container Imports Show Softer Seasonal Decline,"ATLANTA —

Georgia, December 9, 2024 -- Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq: DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, released its December Global Shipping Report for logistics and supply chain professionals. In November 2024, U.S. container import volume decreased 5% from October 2024, which is consistent with seasonal month-over-month declines seen in previous years, though smaller than the 9% decrease over the same period in 2023. Imports from China also declined, though November volumes are 13.3% higher than the same month in 2023, underscoring the continued strength of U.S.–China trade. The December update of the logistics metrics monitored by Descartes continues to demonstrate the strong performance of container imports in 2024; however, the potential introduction of new tariffs by the incoming Trump administration, stalled ILA/USMX contract negotiations, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East may put pressure on global supply chains throughout the balance of the year.

At 2,368,758 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), November U.S. container import volume dipped for the first time in four months below 2.4 million TEUs—a level that previously led to port congestion and delays during the pandemic. Versus November 2023, volume in November 2024 was higher by 12.8%, and up a significant 24.6% from pre-pandemic November 2019. Notably, total imports for the first 11 months (25,829,192 TEUs) of 2024 have already surpassed the 12-month total (24,957,640 TEUs) for 2023—by 871,552 TEUs or 3.5%.

“November has traditionally been a softer month than October; however, compared to the past six years, this year’s month-over-month decline is the smallest by volume (down 125,877 TEUs)” said Jackson Wood, Director, Industry Strategy at Descartes. “While front-loading shipments due to heightened uncertainty around labor unrest and tariffs is a possibility, U.S. container import volumes have been exceptionally strong over peak season this year and, overall, robust throughout 2024.”

162,2024-12-08 00:00:00,NYPD searches for evidence in shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO,"CNN —

As the manhunt for a still-unidentified suspect in the fatal shooting of a health care executive in Manhattan continues on its fifth day, police are missing key pieces of evidence and combing through what they have gathered for more clues.

The New York Police Department is working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies across the country to search for the suspect and offering rewards to the public. Two new photos released by police show the suspect masked with a hood in the backseat of a vehicle and wearing a jacket walking on the street.

While authorities say they believe the suspect has long left New York City after fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday, they feel confident he will be captured.

Here’s what authorities are still trying to find:

The confirmed identity of the suspect

The weapon used in the shooting

The bicycle the suspect used to get away

And here are some of the key pieces of evidence they’ve gathered:

Images of the suspect’s unmasked face

Video evidence of the path he took to escape

A backpack possibly worn by the suspect, with a jacket inside

DNA from a discarded Starbucks water bottle

A partial fingerprint from the water bottle

A discarded “burner” cell phone

9 mm shell casings with the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them

Police divers concluded a search for the weapon in a lake in Central Park on Sunday without finding anything, after searching the park’s iconic boathouse and Bethesda Fountain on Saturday, a law enforcement official told CNN. The divers operated in the same area Sunday, according to footage from CNN affiliate WABC.

A Peak Design backpack was recovered during a second sweep of the park Friday, a law enforcement source told CNN. Police examined it at a forensic lab in Queens. Inside, they found Monopoly money, a law enforcement source told CNN. It also contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN. It was not immediately clear whether other items were in the backpack.

But crucially, there was no gun in the backpack.

There has also still been no sign of the bicycle used by the suspect.

Detectives have released additional photos of a person authorities believe is the suspect in Brian Thompson's killing. NYPD

Meanwhile, photos of the suspect have been circulated to multiple law enforcement agencies, including airports and border patrol stations along the Mexican and Canadian borders, in the hope he won’t slip out of the country.

Police said the suspect mostly wore a mask covering his face as he traveled through New York. “We had to go through lots of video evidence to get that one money shot with the mask down,” said police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, describing a photo of the suspect unmasked in an Upper West Side hostel where he checked in with a fake New Jersey’s driver’s license.

The FBI is offering up to $50,000 of reward money for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The NYPD has added another $10,000.

Piecing together clues

The NYPD released images taken at a hostel of the unmasked shooting suspect. NYPD

Thompson, 50, was shot on a busy Manhattan street early on December 4 as he approached the New York Hilton Midtown on West 54th Street to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The killer was “lying in wait” outside the hotel, Tisch said. The CEO was shot at least once in the back and once in the right calf and declared dead at a hospital.

The shooter then crossed the street from the Hilton and fled northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street. He rode off on an electric bike on 55th, investigators told CNN. From there, the suspect headed north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.

Police say the man was spotted near the George Washington Bridge and George Washington Port Authority bus terminal at 178th Street around 45 minutes after the shooting. Police have obtained video of the suspect entering the Port Authority Bus Station but not exiting it, indicating he left the city.

The killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO has rattled other health care companies concerned about their own leaders’ safety and prompted some of them to ramp up security and scrub top executives’ photos from their websites.

The backpack, photos, surveillance videos, ammunition left behind, a burner phone, a water bottle and DNA evidence have thus far helped investigators get closer to zeroing in on the suspect despite hitting dead ends with the use of facial recognition software and an unusable fingerprint previously obtained by police, according to Joseph Kenny, the NYPD’s chief detective.

A surveillance video clip shows a person authorities believe is the suspect in Brian Thompson's killing riding an electric bike. NYPD

Investigators continue to search for the electric bike the suspect rode the day of the shooting and are examining whether the shooter used a veterinary gun, a larger firearm used on farms and ranches to put down animals without causing a loud noise, Kenny said Friday.

Looking for a motive

The 9 mm shell casings undergoing testing had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, with one word on each of the three bullets, Kenny told reporters.

Police are looking into whether the words, similar in phrasing to a common description of insurance company tactics – “Delay, deny, defend” – may point to a motive. A book critiquing the insurance industry was published with the title “Delay Deny Defend” in 2010.

“That might be him sending a message saying why it was that he shot (Thompson), but at the same time, it could be a diversion to try to get taken away from the real reason behind it,” former FBI Special Agent Kenneth Gray told CNN on Saturday.

“Until he’s caught, we won’t actually know the purpose of those words,” Gray said.

Although the motive remains unclear, authorities have said they believe the killing was premeditated and targeted. The shooter “definitely planned this out,” Kenny told CNN on Friday.

“He knew what time the victim was going to be walking by. He knew what hotel this conference was going to be in,” Kenny said.

Kenny said video of the suspect about 30 minutes before the shooting shows him “walking and wandering around the hotel area before he committed this act.”

The detective said at a Friday briefing there is no evidence the shooter and CEO had any prior interactions or the shooting was related to Thompson’s personal life, according to audio of the briefing the NYPD provided to CNN.

“As we’re going through our investigation, we’re coming across a lot of online comments, a lot of online threats, things of that nature,” Kenny said. “His wife indicated that he had received some prior threats. I don’t know the details of those threats.”

Thompson had worked for UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and was appointed CEO in 2021. He lived in Minnesota and was visiting New York for the company’s annual investor conference. He is survived by his wife Paulette and two children.

The shooting has prompted some to portray the killer as a vigilante enacting justice against a health care system they believe values profits over lives, and some users on social media have mocked the CEO’s death. News of the shooting inspired an outpouring of social media stories about denials of claims from UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies.

What’s next in the investigation?

Police are tracking down as many tips as they can, as the manhunt spreads and authorities try to determine where the suspect might surface.

NYPD officials said they believe the suspect left New York City on an interstate bus, the same mode of transportation investigators believe he used to get to the city days earlier: He traveled to New York on a Greyhound bus starting its route in Atlanta, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN. Those sources added authorities do not know whether the suspect boarded in Atlanta or elsewhere.

The Atlanta Police Department announced Friday, without elaborating, it will assist the investigation after the NYPD contacted it. NYPD detectives arrived in Atlanta on Saturday as part of the probe, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN.

In the meantime, the gun remains the key piece of outstanding evidence police are searching for, as they build a case against the shooter."

164,2024-12-09 16:54:00,Canada Post strike: What shippers should know,"Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Canada Post workers have been on strike since Nov. 15, shutting down the government-owned carrier's operations throughout the country.

The work stoppage comes after Canada Post failed to reach new contract agreements with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents more than 55,000 of the carrier's employees. The union is calling for pay raises, safer working conditions and an expansion of public postal services.

As negotiations continue, shippers with last-mile delivery needs in Canada are diverting volume to other carriers as they try to keep up with the peak holiday ordering rush. But this response is straining many delivery providers' networks during an already busy period.

Here's what parcel shippers should know about the Canada Post strike, including its impact on shipping times and capacity at other carriers.

How long will the Canada Post strike last?

The strike's duration depends on how soon Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers can resolve their differences and reach an agreement.

The parties have exchanged a series of counterproposals on their next labor deal since discussions reignited last week. Jan Simpson, national president of the union, said in a Dec. 4 update that its proposals feature movement on both union and employer demands.

""We all want CUPW members to get back on the job with their rights protected, health and safety issues resolved, wages that reflect inflation, and security for the future in new collective agreements,"" Simpson said.

On Saturday, Canada Post said it has ""made significant moves to close the gap on key issues like weekend delivery, pensions and wages and bring much-needed urgency to the discussions."" However, the Toronto Star reported the next day that the union expressed frustration over the carrier’s latest proposal.

""Based on the union's response, what they've put out to the public, they're still far from seeing eye to eye on these proposals,"" Alison Layfield, director of product development at ePost Global, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.

Whenever the strike ends, its impact will continue to linger. When Canada Post service resumes, delays are likely as the carrier delivers stored volume ""on a first-in, first-out basis,"" according to its website.

Maggie Barnett, CEO of LVK Logistics, a fulfillment provider in Canada and the U.S., expects it will take up to 10 days once the strike ends for Canada Post's operations to normalize.

""Everyone's going to come out of the gate sluggish, and there's going to be a lot to do, because there's things just sitting in the system,"" Barnett said.

How disruptive has the strike been for deliveries?

Delays are mounting throughout the Canada parcel industry due to the strike.

On-time delivery performance in Canada has dropped by 14% since the week of Oct. 28, according to a Dec. 3 report from project44. The company considers a package to be on time if it reaches its destination by the original estimated delivery date.

The steep drop is due in part to Canada Post's major presence in the country's parcel market and limited variety in shippers' carrier rosters, according to project44. While project44 shippers use around six last-mile carriers on average, that falls to less than three for inbound and outbound Canada shipments.

""Because of this lack of carrier diversity, when an event like the postal strike occurs, the Canadian market becomes highly vulnerable to disruptions,"" project44 said. ""Shippers are now scrambling to find capacity and must make tough decisions between cost and delivery time.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimated that the strike would cost small- and medium-sized companies more than $1 billion by Dec. 4, as they grapple with more expensive delivery alternatives and lost orders. One example the federation mentioned was a seed supplier in Prince Edward Island that can't deliver its catalogs during the work stoppage.

""Rather than looking forward to increased revenue, it’s now facing substantial storage fees for the large volume of printed materials and says orders for Christmas will be low,"" the group said.

Can other carriers pick up the slack?

With packages in the Canada Post network at a standstill, many shippers are scrambling to find alternative delivery options. But securing enough capacity with another carrier is a tall order during the holidays, Barnett said.

""That's creating further delays, because the folks who are taking that Canada Post volume are unable to absorb that volume during peak season,"" she said.

Carriers are deploying different strategies to manage the volume influx. This is evident in how UPS and Canada parcel carrier Purolator each handled shipments from eShipper, which connects e-commerce businesses with delivery providers.

UPS froze shipments from eShipper for 48 hours, while Purolator is looking to limit the number of packages it picks up from the company, Imtiaz Kermali, eShipper VP of sales and marketing, said during a Thursday webinar.

""We're going to get to the normality a lot faster if we help these carriers think through what their strategy is right now, which is, let's get rid of these clogs, add more capacity and try and come back even stronger over the next two weeks,"" Kermali said.

UPS did not respond to a request for comment. Purolator is temporarily pausing service to select shipping partners as it navigates ""a significant increase in volume,"" the company told Supply Chain Dive on Thursday.

""This was necessary to maintain the integrity of our network, ensure the health and safety of our employees and allow us to prioritize critical shipments,"" Purolator said in an email. ""We are assessing the condition of our network hourly and will make all attempts to remove the service suspension as soon as possible.""

Other carriers are also adjusting in the wake of the strike. On Nov. 29, the U.S. Postal Service suspended its acceptance of international mail to Canada. FedEx has instituted ""a temporary limit of five packages per drop-off"" at its retail locations to manage higher demand, a company spokesperson told CBC News on Friday.

How can shippers limit disruptions from the strike?

Securing access to carriers that suit your particular shipping needs goes a long way, experts say.

For example, shippers with packages moving from the U.S. into Canada should make sure they're using a ""door-to-door"" service that doesn't rely on Canada Post for any portion of the delivery process, Barnett said.

Companies also have to consider what areas of Canada they deliver to. While a handful of major carriers can cover around 80% to 90% of the country, that service typically comes with a residential delivery surcharge, Kermali said. Smaller, regional carriers tend not to have this added fee, but they also are limited in coverage outside major cities.

""They do not criss-cross across the country, connecting those regions unless they have an outside partner that could be an airline or a ground partner who will move product from, let's say, Toronto to Vancouver, and then they'll deliver in Vancouver,"" Kermali added.

Beyond carrier adjustments, companies should also consider how to keep customers happy during the strike, Jen Seran, former director of business operations at e-commerce shipping provider Stallion Express, wrote in a LinkedIn post. This includes providing clear and transparent communication about potential delays, leveraging physical store locations for pickups and offering discounted or free shipping.

""While the current disruptions pose challenges, they also offer a chance to get creative with your logistics,"" Seran said."
165,2024-12-08 00:00:00,What Do New Airline Compensation Rules Mean For Your Next Flight?,"How will the government's proposed new rules affect your next flight? getty

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) last week proposed a new rule that would require airlines to compensate passengers for lengthy delays. It would mandate airlines to pay cash compensation, rebook passengers on the next available flight, and cover expenses for meals, accommodations, and transportation if a delay is caused by the carrier. I asked Anthony Radchenko, CEO of AirAdvisor, a company that helps air travelers recover compensation from airlines, to explain what this new rule could mean for passengers.

What was your initial reaction when you heard about this proposed DOT rule?

It's definitely a positive move and well overdue. For a long time, the U.S. has lagged behind other countries like those in the EU, Brazil, Canada, and even Turkey, which already have regulations protecting passengers from flight disruptions. U.S. airlines received a lot of taxpayer money during the pandemic and have been problematic with refunds, so this rule feels necessary.

The DOT is proposing that airlines pay between $200 and $300 for domestic delays of three hours or more. Do you think that’s enough?

Not really. I think it's a bit low, honestly. The regulation sets a good standard, but it's based on the EU amounts, which haven't kept up with inflation. I think it should be increased to account for inflation.

By how much?

For a delay of three hours or more, $450 to $500 seems more reasonable. Two hundred dollars doesn't go very far, especially if you miss a connecting flight or a cruise that you might have booked through the airline. Those kinds of disruptions can cost passengers thousands of dollars. And if a flight is delayed until late at night, passengers may be stuck paying a lot for a taxi because public transportation might not be running. Keep in mind that cash compensation should compensate for inconvenience and distress and not fall short of covering out of pocket expenses.

You mentioned the European consumer protection regulation, EC 261, which went into effect in 2003. How has that affected air travel in Europe?

The EU regulation has been a positive development for passengers. It has definitely reduced the number of delays over three hours and cancellations.

There's no specific data on its impact on flight networks overall, but it has made flying more punctual in Europe. Airlines are now taking more precautions to avoid delays. They are investing more in parts warehouses, keeping crews on standby, and just doing better planning in general.

How do you think the airlines are going to respond to this new DOT rule?

Airlines are going to fight to water down this regulation as much as possible. Based on what’s happened in Canada, I expect they will try to claim safety issues to get out of paying compensation, even if the issues aren’t really safety-related.

They’ll also probably lobby to prevent passengers from recovering legal fees, because they know that will make it harder for people to enforce their rights. If passengers have to pay their own legal fees and the compensation is only a few hundred dollars, it just wouldn’t be worth it for them to go to court. For this reason I believe regulation shall specifically provide passengers the right to recover attorney's fees if airlines fail to comply with these rules.

Airlines are already saying this rule is going to cause airfares to go up. Do you think it will?

Some low-cost airlines have added a surcharge to their tickets to cover potential compensation payouts, but it’s really insignificant — something like $2 per ticket. And for traditional airlines, the surcharge would be even less noticeable. I don’t think people would mind paying a few extra dollars if it meant their flights were more likely to be on time.

So, looking ahead, how do you think this rule will change the flying experience in the U.S.?

I think we will see a lot more punctuality. There is a noticeable difference between flying on a U.S. airline versus an airline from the UK or Europe. This rule could help eliminate that disparity. Even if it’s a weakened version of what the DOT is proposing, it’s still a step in the right direction.

You’ve been critical of the airlines’ lack of accountability, particularly during the pandemic. Do you think this rule could address some of those concerns?

Absolutely. What happened with the refunds during the pandemic was ridiculous. Airlines basically told people to sue them if they wanted their money back.

This rule would give passengers some recourse when airlines fail to meet their obligations. It’s not just about the money; it’s about holding airlines accountable for their actions."

Commuters passing through a new subway station in Thessaloniki, Greece, can expect to see far more than high-tech turnstiles and digital departure boards. Beneath their feet also lie remains of a central ancient Roman road paved in marble and lined with columns.

Workers unearthed the thoroughfare, first laid more than 2,300 years ago, during excavations to build the city’s new, fully automated metro system, whose main line opened to the public on Nov. 30. The discovery, dubbed “a Byzantine Pompeii” by one academic, sparked heated debate. Project engineers argued the historical remnants needed to be moved to continue construction, while cultural preservationists insisted the artifacts remain in situ as a monument to the city’s history visible in their original setting.

In the end, after much controversy, the preservationists prevailed. The company behind the transportation project redesigned the metro line, boring subway tunnels 102 feet deeper than originally planned so the once-bustling road that ran through a Byzantine market could remain intact as an open archaeological site. Today, a stretch of the street, along with fragments of stone walls that housed shops and other public buildings, form part of a subterranean museum within Venizelou Station, where visitors hurrying to and from driverless trains can glimpse the distant past through transparent suspended floors.

It’s a “truly unique technical project which highlights all the cultural richness of the city,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Instagram after touring the station along with Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and other government officials.

Greece’s second largest city sits on the Thermaic Gulf at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. Cassander, a king of Macedon, founded Thessaloniki around 316 BCE and named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great. The Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans all traversed the city, leaving their imprints.

Thessaloniki’s much-anticipated metro system took nearly two decades to complete, delayed by funding challenges during the financial crisis that plunged Greece into debt default and depression, and by the tension between preserving antiquities and advancing modern urban transport in a city with a metropolitan area of more than a million inhabitants.

“The project faced substantial delays and many challenges, including over 300,000 archaeological finds, many of which are now showcased at various stations along the main line,” Christos Staikouras, Greece’s minister of transport and infrastructure, told reporters during a media tour of the subway system before it opened, the Associated Press reported. The new line is expected to accommodate 250,000 travelers daily, according to Greece’s ministry of transport and infrastructure.

In addition to the Roman road on display at Venizelou Station, other archaeological treasures unearthed during the metro’s construction include a Greek cemetery full of funerary monuments, an early Christian basilica and water and drainage systems.

Some of the smaller finds, such as mosaic and pottery shards, jewelry and utensils from across centuries, are now on display at various stops along the 13-station metro line, which extends almost 6 miles. These “archaeo stations” blend contemporary transit with priceless antiquities, invite travelers not just to commute, but to journey through time."

T he Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed on Thursday new rules that would require airlines to compensate passengers between $200 and $775 for significant flight delays or cancellations where the airline is at fault, such as a mechanical delay, staffing issue or IT failure like the one that caused Southwest’s $825-million meltdown over the Christmas holidays in 2022. In addition, carriers would be required to rebook passengers on other airlines.

“This action we’re announcing is another step forward into a better era for commercial air travel—where the flying public is better protected and passengers aren’t expected to bear the cost of disruptions caused by airlines,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.

The proposed rules are similar to the protections already enjoyed by travelers elsewhere in the world, such as in Canada, Brazil, in the European Union and the United Kingdom, says Eric Napoli, Chief Legal Officer at AirHelp, an online consumer-advocacy service that helps airline passengers seek compensation for flight cancellations, delays, or overbookings.

For example, the European law (known as EU261 and UK261) pertains to flights into, out of, or within the EU and the UK. If a flight is canceled within two weeks of the flight date or if a flight is delayed by three hours or more, and the reason for the delay is something within the airline’s control, the passenger is entitled to up to 600 euros ($634) in compensation.

Airlines for America (A4A), the U.S. airline industry’s lobbying group, said the law is unnecessary. “In this highly competitive industry, carriers don’t need further incentive to provide quality service,” the group said in a statement. “An analysis of the European scheme that DOT is attempting to emulate shows that government-mandated additional compensation needlessly drives up the cost of flying while negatively impacting operations.”

But one study from the European University Institute found that the EU’s compensation and service requirements reduced both the likelihood and duration of flight delays.

Consumer watchdog groups have also noted a positive impact from the European law, which went into effect in 2020. “For example, the tarmac delay, where you’re just waiting to take off,” Napoli says. “That doesn't happen in Europe. People are not sitting on the plane for four or five hours waiting for the plane to take off. The airline would have to pay you 600 euros, right? So those things don't happen.”

“A4A carriers are providing automatic refunds if the passenger chooses not to be rebooked—regardless of whether the significant delay or cancellation is within the carrier’s control—and also providing reimbursements for food, transportation and lodging for significant controllable delays,” said the A4A statement.

But airlines only began issuing automatic refunds in May after being forced to do so by the Biden administration in its years-long war on so-called “junk fees.” Previously, airlines typically issued vouchers instead of cash reimbursements, and only after a passenger had jumped through a series of hoops.

The DOT is now proposing the following levels of compensation:

$200-300 for domestic flight delays of three to six hours

$375-525 for delays between six and nine hours

$750-775 for delays of nine hours or more

“It’s a huge step forward, really,” says Napoli. “Imagine that you’ve flown for the weekend somewhere, and your flight gets canceled or delayed for 10 hours, and you can’t get back until the next day at least. That money that can really help you out in those moments, when you’ve got to spend out of pocket right away to put yourself into a hotel until the next available flight.”

The DOT is inviting public comments on these proposals for the next 60 days.

M eanwhile, executives from five major U.S. airlines—American, Delta, United, Spirit and Frontier—were grilled by a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday over charging excessive ancillary or “junk” fees for everything from seat selection to checked and carry-on bags.

“Airlines like to say that they offer lower fares and more choices but the fact of the matter is that those lower fares, economy-class, are basically for people who travel with no more than the shirt on their back and the underwear and socks they have on,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chaired the panel.

In an industry characterized by tight margins and intense competition, so-called junk fees have been a cash cow for carriers around the world. A study released in October by IdeaWorks estimated global airline ancillary revenue will hit $148.4 billion in 2024—a 26% jump compared to $117.9 billion last year. All told, ancillary revenue now makes up roughly 15% of the industry’s total $996 billion revenue projected by the IATA.

Between 2018 and 2023, the five airlines at Wednesday’s Senate hearing, which together control 60% of the domestic air travel market, collected $12.4 billion in revenue from seat fees alone, according to a report released last week by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

Throughout Wednesday’s Senate hearing, airline officials defended their business models. “Our seat selection products are all voluntary,” Stephen Johnson, American’s chief strategy officer, said in written testimony. “For customers who value sitting in more in-demand locations, we do offer the opportunity to pay for more desirable seats.”

Frontier’s chief commercial officer, Bobby Schroeter, claimed his company’s “transparent model” allows Frontier to keep its base fares “extremely low for the benefit of consumers.”

Seat fees—where passengers pay extra for additional legroom, a front-of-plane row for quicker deplaning, or a window or aisle seat—have rivaled baggage fees in recent years as the industry’s biggest source of ancillary revenue. Even Southwest Airlines, which for half a century has offered free open seating, announced earlier this year that it will shift to assigned seats in early 2026.

“When President Biden took office, none of the major airlines guaranteed fee free family seating,” the DOT said in a statement provided to Forbes. “Today, thanks to DOT actions and pressure, five of the 10 largest U.S. airlines no longer charge parents to sit next to their young children.”

“We don't know yet exactly what the new administration will will do, whether they'll kind of follow in these steps or not,” says Napoli. “I can tell you that there are people in the administration, like vice Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, who travels with with small children a lot so he knows kind of the impact of issues like family seating.”

Forbes Frontier And Spirit Airlines Ditch Key Fees In Time For Summer

Baggage fees were another bone of contention at Wednesday’s hearing. The Senate subcommittee scolded Frontier and Spirit Airlines, in particular, for paying gate agents incentives of roughly $26 million in 2022 and 2023 to encourage enforcement of bag policies.

For any small bag—think purse, laptop bag, briefcase, diaper bag— that’s larger than 14 in. x 18 in. x 8 in., “including handles, wheels and straps,” Frontier charges a minimum of $54 per item.

“These are shoplifters, these are people that are stealing,” Frontier CEO Barry Biffle told Reuters this week. “It’s not equitable to everyone who follows the rules.”

Frontier defended paying gate agents $10 every time they identify a passenger trying to board with a personal item larger than the permitted size. “We recognize this is a tough job and, therefore, we incentivize them to do that,” Schroeter told the panel of senators."
170,2024-12-05 00:00:00,Airlines Could Be Forced To Pay Passengers For Delays—Here's How Much,"Topline

Airlines could be forced to pay passengers up to $775 for extended delays on domestic flights, allow them to rebook at no additional cost and cover any meals, lodging or transportation-related expenses for passengers ""stranded"" due to delays that could reasonably be blamed on the airline, according to a new rule proposed by the Department of Transportation Thursday.

Key Facts

The DOT Thursday proposed new rules that would, for the first time, force U.S. airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for airline-caused disruptions like mechanical issues, maintenance or crew problems or an IT airline system breakdown. If approved, the rule would force airlines to pay passengers between $200 and $300 for domestic flights delayed between three and six hours, $375 to $525 for delays between six and nine hours and $750 to $775 for delays of nine hours or more. DOT is also considering how to structure the tiered payment structure—like if small airlines should pay less than large airlines, for example—and whether or not the companies should have to pay if a passenger is notified a week or two in advance of a cancellation or significant delay. Most airlines already allow passengers to rebook on the same airline at no additional cost if a flight is canceled, but the new DOT rules could make airlines extend that policy to any passenger whose departure is delayed three hours or more domestically or six hours or more internationally, or if a delay results in a missed connection. The proposal also suggests making airlines cover the cost of meals, overnight lodging and related transportation expenses to passengers who are stranded overnight—and to require a minimum reimbursement for each service without the need to submit receipts. The DOT's Thursday announcement was a notice of proposed rule making, and the agency must accept public comment for the next 60 days before issuing a final decision.

Big Number

116 million. That's how many passengers were impacted by flight delays from July 2021 to April 2022, according to the Government Accountability Office.

Surprising Fact

More than 60% of three-hour-or-longer domestic flight delays were airline-caused in both 2022 and 2023, according to data from U.S. airlines submitted to DOT.

Contra

Airlines For America, a trade association that represents some of the nation's biggest airlines, told NBC News the new rules would ""drive up ticket prices, make air travel less accessible for price-sensitive travelers and negatively impact carrier operations.”

Key Background

Flight delays in the United States reached a decade high in 2023 as cancelations dipped to their lowest point since 2016. More than 22% of all flights experienced some sort of delay last year, almost 2% more than in 2022 and the highest percentage since 2014, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. According to the DOT's air travel consumer data for August of 2024, the most recent available, Delta airlines was the most on-time major airline in the U.S. with less than 80% of flights arriving at their projected time. JetBlue was the most disrupted airline, with only 60% of flights arriving on time. About 75% of flights across major carriers arrived on time between January and August of this year. San Francisco International had the highest delay percentage of any airport in the first half of 2024—37.18% of flights were delayed—and Buffalo Niagara International had the highest cancellation rate at 2.74%.

Imagine a world where smart machines zip around our cities without anyone behind the wheel. Traffic jams, accidents and fatalities are things of the past. These self-driving vehicles would not only safely transport people and goods, but they would also handle heavy tasks like farming, mining and building homes.

This future has been a dream since even before the famous DARPA Grand Challenge that jump-started the race for autonomous vehicles in 2004. Thanks to the latest breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), this dream is becoming a reality.

Then And Now

If machine learning has existed since the 1950s, why is today any different? The change comes from new ways of designing AI models, better techniques for handling data and a huge increase in computing power.

In the past, adding more data to a machine learning model only helped up to a certain point. But in 2017, a new kind of AI model called the transformer was introduced, removing previous limitations on how much a model could learn.

Now, the more data you feed these models, the better they become. Instead of training on millions of data points—the “big data” of the 2010s—researchers can now use trillions of data points collected from across the internet.

However, bigger models and more data require more computing power. To meet this need, companies have built massive data centers filled with thousands of specialized chips designed for AI tasks. These advancements have ushered in a new era for machine learning: the age of the “foundation model.”

The Foundation Model Era

Previously, if you wanted to train a machine learning model to do a specific task—like recognizing pedestrians in car camera images—you had to collect and manually label thousands or even millions of real-world examples. The model would learn by being shown pictures with and without pedestrians and adjusting itself to make correct classifications. Once trained, the model was fixed in its behavior; if you asked it to identify a bus in an image, it couldn’t do it.

Foundation models change this by training on simpler, more fundamental tasks using much larger amounts of data. In our pedestrian example, the task might be filling in a missing part of an image. For language models, it’s predicting the next word in a sentence.

Training models this way makes them highly adaptable. A foundation model trained on all the images on the internet could identify not only pedestrians but also traffic cones, strollers, dogs, cats, coffee mugs—you name it. Many of these models can also handle multiple types of data at once, like images and text.

This newfound versatility means that creating models for a particular task has become much cheaper. Instead of needing to see thousands of training examples, a large foundation model can learn only from a few examples of what you want. With just a few “shots,” the model can perform specialized tasks like translating a language or identifying images of buses.

These new capabilities, especially in handling different types of data simultaneously, may lead to a future where we can interact directly with machines. Instead of programming them with code, we’ll simply ask for help in plain language, just as we would with another person.

Even better, these machines may be able to respond and explain their thoughts and actions. For example, soon we may able to tell our self-driving cars our preferences for driving style, temperature, music and more, just like we would with a human driver.

The Next Generation Of Autonomous Vehicles

Recent advancements in AI models, data and computing power have also brought significant changes to the development of self-driving cars, leading to what’s being called AV 2.0. For most autonomous vehicles, there are four main components:

1. Perception: What’s around me?

2. Localization: Where am I, based on what I see?

3. Planning: Given where I am and what’s happening around me, how do I get to my destination?

4. Controls: How do I operate the car’s accelerator, brakes and steering to follow that path?

In the earlier “AV 1.0” systems, only the perception part used machine learning, while the other parts relied on manually written rules. In “AV 2.0,” every component uses machine learning. This not only enhances the car’s ability to see but also allows it to behave more naturally in situations where strict rules might fail—for example, crossing a solid yellow line to go around a double-parked car.

However, adding more machine learning models to the self-driving system brings challenges in testing and verifying these vehicles.

Companies currently rely heavily on simulations to ensure that new versions meet a wide range of requirements. AV 2.0 systems are more sensitive to differences between real-world data and simulated data, so simulations need to be as realistic as possible. Instead of using hand-built 3D environments and pre-programmed vehicle behaviors, future testing will need to use advanced machine learning techniques to create highly realistic and scalable simulations.

The Future Of AI In Vehicles

It’s crucial for car manufacturers and the wider vehicle industry to adopt AI technologies in their development processes and products. There’s enormous potential for improved autonomous driving capabilities, better interaction between humans and machines and increased productivity for developers.

Just as software revolutionized many industries, AI is set to do the same—but even faster. Companies that quickly embrace these technologies may have a first-mover advantage and the chance to set industry standards. Those that delay may quickly fall behind, as their products will lack features compared to competitors.

172,2024-12-03 00:00:00,Amtrak carries record number of passengers for fiscal 2024,"CNN —

Amtrak has reached a historic milestone, carrying 32.8 million passengers on the passenger rail system in fiscal year 2024. That’s a 15% increase from the previous fiscal year when it carried nearly 28.6 million riders, according to a news release from Amtrak.

“This record ridership shows that travelers throughout the U.S. want efficient travel options, and we are committed to meeting that demand,” said Stephen Gardner, Amtrak’s CEO, in the release.

Amtrak said its goal is to double its ridership to 66 million passengers a year by 2040.

The rail service has struggled to financially recover after the pandemic disturbed usual ridership patterns. Gardner predicted it would take at least five years for the company to break even after its initial losses in 2020.

Transforming infrastructure

To address prior challenges, the rail service has invested $4.5 billion into its most extensive infrastructure and fleet transformation to date, the news release said.

Additionally, Amtrak received more than $10 billion in competitive federal grant funds to support current and future building projects.

The first-of-its-kind project has spurred unprecedented growth for Amtrak, employing thousands of skilled workers to improve the customer experience.

“As we build for the future, our investments in new equipment, expanded service, and critical infrastructure will continue to elevate the experience from coast to coast,” said Roger Harris, president of Amtrak, in the news release.

Expected proposals include the development of new trains, bridges and tunnels.

Among the ambitious projects being planned: the replacement of the 151-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel to alleviate the congestion and delays between Washington, D.C., and New Jersey.

New routes, better stations

Amtrak is also expanding its network with new train routes and upgraded stations. And these projects aren’t just in the busy Northeast corridor.

Amtrak is set to reintroduce a route to service the Gulf Coast for the first time in two decades. Starting in 2025, a twice-daily train service will run between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama.

Riders in North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maine will also see upgrades to their routes, alongside the development of 69 new intercity passenger rail corridors.

Special perks

Amtrak said budget-conscious travelers can look forward to more affordable options including Flex Fare and Value Fare tickets.

Customers without concrete travel plans may find Flex Fare useful because of its fully refundable guarantee. However, travelers with more certain arrangements might prefer Flex tickets, which are cheaper and offer a 75% refund if canceled.

Passengers can also expect changes in booking seats and in dining options.

For those interested in specialty upgrades, customers in select service classes can now make their final seat selection before booking the reservation.

Premium travelers on Acela trains, Amtrak’s flagship high-speed service along the Northeast Corridor, can also enjoy an upgraded dining with sustainably sourced ingredients and local brands."
173,2024-12-03 11:17:00,What shippers and carriers seek from a modern TMS,"When Mattress Next Day CEO Martin Seeley first considered adopting a transportation management system, he wasn't sure the technology was the right fit for the online mattress retailer.

But once Mattress Next Day implemented Transporeon’s TMS, Seeley realized it was a game changer “for next-day delivery businesses like mine.” The TMS’ critical features include real-time visibility, route planning and scheduling.

Supply chains have become more global and intermodal, and consumers want fast shipping and real-time visibility. Shippers and carriers need a TMS that integrates with other systems and uses emerging technology to keep up with modern demands.

Numerous feature-rich TMS platforms are on the market, but there's always room for improvement, especially as logistics challenges evolve.

“TMS’s are great. They do a lot of things really well,” said Brock Johns, director analyst in the logistics and technology team at Gartner. “But they don't necessarily solve all problems.”

A connected, integrated TMS

Above all, shippers and carriers’ want their TMS’s to integrate smoothly with other technology systems. For shippers, that primarily means connecting to warehouse and yard management systems to avoid keeping data siloed in separate applications.

Integrating technology platforms is especially important today, when businesses often have several sourcing locations and myriad modes of transport, Johns said.

“I hesitate to say we'll eventually get to ‘the everything TMS,’” Johns said. “But I think we are slowly, incrementally inching [in] that direction.”

Lining up transportation and inventory with an integrated TMS helps shippers — and by extension, consumers — trace freight throughout the supply chain.

Ray Lauzums, the owner of online toys, games and collectibles retailer Poggers, said his Tailwind TMS is “super useful for connecting everything we do,” including invoicing, recording driver logs and managing transportation data. In the future, he’d like to see the TMS integrate with internet-connected devices and blockchain.

“I hesitate to say we'll eventually get to ‘the everything TMS.’ But I think we are slowly, incrementally inching [in] that direction.” Brock Johns Director analyst in the logistics and technology team at Gartner

Brett Phillips, president and CEO of The 1975 Transportation Group, uses McLeod’s TMS and was able to integrate the system with telematics and electronic data interchange. Phillips said a TMS is a must-have in today’s operating environment, as fleets have endured a long freight recession and high costs, making it critical to stay lean.

“Automation within your TMS helps your team do more with fewer people,” Phillips said.

Carriers often work with multiple brokers on several different load boards, which aren’t tied directly into the carrier TMS. That can lead to “app fatigue,” said Sean Gill, VP of business solutions at Arrive Logistics, as carriers are asked to download dozens of different apps.

Arrive Logistics has built a proprietary TMS with web portals for carriers and shippers. Businesses also have access to Arrive's load data through an API integration, enabling them to view load information directly in their own TMS.

As tech evolves, so should TMS platforms

A lot of existing technology hasn't been optimized for TMS platforms yet. For example, some TMS’s are still web- or desktop-based and are not compatible for mobile devices, Gill said.

That was one reason Seeley picked Transporeon. He said its mobile access “runs very smoothly,” compared to others such as SAP, which has “poorly built” mobile access apps.

Email integration is another shortcoming for some TMS platforms. “As much data as we store in a TMS, there is probably five times as much data in email inboxes,” Gill said. This disconnect leads to manual data transfer, or information that never makes it into the TMS.

TMS vendors have started to address the disconnect between email and TMS platforms. Arrive Logistics’ software scans carrier inboxes and classifies email, entering the information into the TMS.

Other technologies, such as predictive analytics and artificial intelligence, are newer to the market, and carriers and shippers are eager to see those capabilities come to TMS platforms.

“As much data as we store in a TMS, there is probably five times as much data in email inboxes."" Sean Gill VP of business solutions at Arrive Logistics

Lauzums said he wants machine learning in a TMS that can more quickly predict delivery times and spot problematic shipments to avoid delays, an issue his company faced during a recent snowstorm.

“Tailwind flagged the delay accurately. But they didn't give any ideas on how it might affect other routes or potential fixes,” Lauzums said. “If Tailwind's machine learning could predict delays better, we could have talked to customers sooner about options to keep things on schedule.”

Phillips said he’d like to see more TMS-generated fleet summaries and dashboards to help automate KPI monitoring.

Beyond that, AI and large language models are starting to change how users interact with TMS platforms. Think of it as “chatbots on steroids,” Johns said. Instead of inputting bill of lading numbers, a user can ask the status of a shipment going from A to B and receive the answer in real time. If a customer calls to ask for a status update, this could save time, as the language model can finds answers rather than a person manually searching by order number.

Generative AI also has the potential to make TMS interfaces more user-friendly. If a company’s resident TMS expert leaves the firm, “there's a dearth of that knowledge,” Johns said. But Gen AI can allow interaction with the TMS in a way that’s intuitive, such as allowing users to ask how to do a task or where to find a specific data point.

Johns said TMS vendors are starting to explore how this capability can fit into the TMS.

“It's a way to extend the knowledge to much broader groups of people and empower more people that can use that TMS,” he noted."
174,2024-12-01 00:00:00,EU Drive To Force EV Adoption Looks Set To Stumble,"Porsche is resuming developing ICE technology for the Panamera, and Cayenne SUV getty

The day of reckoning is imminent for the European Union’s drive to force its citizens into buying electric vehicles against their will.

Unless the EU tones down its attempt to create a market based on a politicians’ wish list rather than consumer demand, it will cause existential damage to the flagship European automotive industry, and risks a political backlash, analysts say.

EV supporters aren’t happy and won’t countenance any tinkering with the plan. Expect much argument in the European and British Parliaments.

The EU demands EVs account for about 80% of new car sales in 2030, and 100% by 2035. Britain is expected to bring the 100% date forward to 2030. But sales of EVs across Europe have stalled because they are too expensive and don’t offer the all-round utility of an internal combustion engine vehicle. Charging networks are too thin on the ground, have clunky payment systems and a reputation for unreliability.

“The targets are too optimistic and are not aligned to today’s reality. They might have been the correct objectives 5 years ago when the Chinese did not play their part, and there was a solid demand for all kinds of cars. The situation has changed dramatically and so should the targets. Otherwise, there are big economic and social risks,” said JATO Dynamics Global Analyst Felipe Munoz in an email.

It is becoming clear that the path to a market dominated by EVs is hopelessly ambitious and needs to be amended. If not, Europe’s auto industry will be mortally wounded.

The EU and Britain decided in the name of saving the planet from global warming to force what it considered to be the only option for slashing carbon dioxide emissions from transport – battery-electric sedans and SUVs. That meant laying down a strict timetable for cutting CO2 emissions.

Incapable of providing affordable EVs

The trouble is Europe’s automakers have shown themselves incapable of providing enough affordable EVs. China is way ahead of Europe and could easily fill the gap, but that would cripple, if not destroy, the European industry. Automakers have been reluctant to protest in public against the EU regime, worrying that would undermine their image with the public.

German automakers were the first to break ranks and demand a dilution of the CO2 rules. In Britain, Nissan recently protested local CO2 rules as it announced output cuts and job losses. Stellantis’s U.K. subsidiary Vauxhall shut a plant employing 1,100 workers. Ford UK has asked the government to relax the rules. The British government has said it will look at the rules after the industry warned it will cost billions of pounds in extra costs and fines.

Evidence is mounting that the rate of expansion in EV sales will not come close to the 2030 target.

“EV share in Europe has reached 22% in the first 10 months of 2024 quite a way behind forecasts from 2022 expecting 35% EV penetration in 2025,” Bernstein Research said in report.

EV sales in 2024 will reach about 2 million in Europe but will need to more than quadruple to reach the 2030 target. Recent forecast downgrades show the target is getting further away.

In late November, investment researcher Jefferies slashed more than two million sales from its 2030 forecast. The 2030 forecast now stands at 4.7 million for a market share of 35%, down from the previous 50%. In June, Jefferies cut its Europe forecast to 6.8 million in 2030 from the 8.9 million published late last year.

In April, investment bank UBS said Europeans will buy almost nine million fewer electric vehicles between 2024 and 2030 than expected. UBS cut its forecast for European EV sales to 8.3 million in 2030 compared with its previous estimate of 9.6 million.

Schmidt Automotive Research reckons in 2024 West European EV sales will hit 1.9 million for a market share of 16.6%. In 2025 there will be a big jump to 2.7 million (22.2%) as EU CO2 rules tighten. Sales will advance by about 5 million between then and 2030 to 57% of the market, according to Schmidt.

Expect Brussels to extend past 2035

Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany, expects EU politicians to concede that damage limitation requires concessions to the automakers, including a delay to the 2035 outright ban on ICE vehicles.

“I think the ban of ICE in 2035 will be discussed in Brussels (EU headquarters) and they will decide not to ban. If that is the case, they will also abandon the 80% EV rule for 2030,” Dudenhoeffer said in an email exchange.

European politicians are gradually coming around to the need for changes.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the EU should retain the rules but suspend fines for CO2 rule transgressors, allowing the manufacturers to use the funds to improve their EV technology.

German luxury sports-car maker Porsche reflected manufacturers’ EV wariness by saying it would develop new ICE technology to meet demand for combustion-powered Cayenne and Panamera models as EV sales weakened. Volvo has slowed its path to 100% EVs.

The German transition to EVs cost 46,000 jobs between 2019 and 2023 and will cost another 140,000 by 2035, according to a study by German auto industry association VDA. Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker is threatening to shut at least three factories in Germany.

This isn’t going down well with EV supporters. Peter Ramsay, in a column for the EVinFocus newsletter, said climate think tanks, trade unions and some unnamed manufacturers who are confident of reaching the CO2 targets are pushing back from this attempt to water down the rules.

Ramsay reports EU member states like Czechia and Italy were seeking to postpone the timetable or limit the penalties for failure. Czechia called for technological neutrality, which would mean market mechanisms deciding the winners between EVs, hybrids, plug-in hybrids e-fuelled ICE, and fuel cells.

“In other words, taxpayer money for the nonsense of FCEVs (fuel-cell electric vehicles) as a vehicle passenger solution and/or e-fuels to try to keep ICE expertise on life support for a little bit longer,” Ramsay said.

Hopeless EU targets

EV sales are expected to return to a higher gear but the pace required to reach EU targets looks hopeless, according to JATO Dynamics’ Munoz. He points out the European market overall has lost around 3 million sales since before the Covid pandemic.

“This negative reality is not a good start for the expected shift from ICE to EV that the authorities want, especially if the EVs continue to be so expensive.”

“EV registrations through October 2024 posted a 2% drop vs Jan-Oct/23. In the best of cases, a 5% increase annually between 2025 and 2030 would take EV volumes to something around 3 million units. Last year, the whole new car market registered 12.8 million units. In the best of the cases a 15% annual increase in EV demand would take the EVs total to 5.1 million, still far from last year’s 12.8 million units, and quite unrealistic. You can’t have an annual increase of 15%,” Munoz said.

Munoz said much cheaper batteries will soon cut the price of EVs, but Western countries still don’t control the supply for battery component because China does.

“This dependence on China is dangerous and can have an impact on the goals set by the EU and the U.K. As long as Europe and the U.S. don’t have control over the raw materials to produce their own batteries, their EV industries won’t be competitive.”

“The (recently introduced) tariffs on Chinese EVs are just a short-term solution that doesn’t solve the real problem: the lack of competitiveness of European and American industries,” Munoz said."

Editor’s Note: Read the latest on the lake-effect snow here. This story is no longer being updated.

As biting cold temperatures sweep across a large swath of the US, parts of the Great Lakes face more than a foot of additional lake-effect snow through Tuesday – the latest complication for cities already blanketed by snowfall amid post-Thanksgiving travel.

More than 5 feet of snow fell on parts of western New York the last few days, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center, with some places exceeding the 4-foot mark Sunday. Barnes Corners, New York, saw 65.5 inches – over 5 feet – by Monday morning, according to the weather service.

Lake-effect warnings for parts of western New York, northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania are in effect into Tuesday.

The cold will persist, as nearly 70% of the continental US will feel the chill of temperatures below 32 degrees over the next few days. Some cities, including New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cincinnati, will experience below-average temperatures for the entire week.

Homeowners in Erie, Pennsylvania, shoveled large piles of snow and used snowblowers to clear the mounds from their driveways and walkways Saturday, according to footage from CNN affiliate WICU.

“Yesterday, I shoveled for four hours and today I’ve been here for about an hour,” Erie resident and native Richard Korytowski told WICU as he dug out his driveway.

“I expected to shovel,” he said, “but not this much.”

Lake-effect snow occurs when cold, wind-driven air flows across a not-so-cold lake – in this case, the Great Lakes, where the water is at a record warmth.

In Erie, treacherous conditions on Sunday caused some of the city’s plow drivers to get stuck while removing snow, city officials said on Facebook.

Eleven counties across western and central New York are under a state of emergency order Gov. Kathy Hochul issued Friday. The declaration includes Erie County, where Amherst officials on Saturday issued a code blue alert, inviting anyone in need of shelter from the extreme cold to call for help.

“My administration is working around the clock to respond to the snowstorm in Western New York and the North Country,” Hochul said on X Saturday. “Our state agencies and over 100 National Guard members are on the ground to support storm operations.”

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also called in his state’s National Guard on Saturday to assist stranded motorists and ensure emergency responders can reach anyone trapped, he said on X.

Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 road incidents over a 24-hour period on Friday and Saturday, according to Shapiro’s office.

The winter weather came as millions of Thanksgiving revelers across the country traveled home from the holiday weekend. Postholiday travel was “very difficult to impossible” for some motorists, with forecasters urging people to stay off the roads as whiteout conditions make driving “treacherous and potentially dangerous,” according to the National Weather Service office in Buffalo, New York.

Road conditions in western New York quickly deteriorated from Adams to Watertown in Jefferson County on Sunday. Janelle Kriegbaum told CNN her family was traveling back home from her son’s hockey tournament and had to wade through several feet of snow to reach their front door.

“It took my husband over two hours to clear the driveway with his snowblower, and we have a very small driveway,” Kriegbaum said.

The outbreak of Arctic chill diving southward out of Canada is causing temperatures in much of the eastern half of the US to fall as much as 15 degrees to 25 degrees below average, which will persist through the middle of next week, forecasters said.

The Weather Prediction Center called for temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below average Monday, from the Northern Plains into the Ohio Valley, “spreading farther southeast along much of the east coast by Monday.”

Through Monday, an additional foot-plus of snow could fall in parts of Pennsylvania, northern Ohio and western New York.

“The heaviest snow totals are expected downwind of lakes Erie and Ontario, affecting areas from northeast Ohio, far northwest Pennsylvania, western New York state and portions of northwest New York state,” according to the Weather Prediction Center.

North East, Pennsylvania, a borough in Erie County, recorded just over 42 inches of snow between Thursday night and Saturday afternoon while Erie, Pennsylvania, received 31 inches.

In Ashtabula County, Ohio, resident Ashley Drew shared footage of a Conneaut home vanishing into a blanket of heavy snow Saturday, with its blue front door just partially visible as snow continued to fall.

Parts of the county, which sits on Lake Erie, have seen about 40 inches of snowfall and it could see between 12 and 21 inches more through Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service in Cleveland.

Cars and roadways nearly disappeared under snowfall in Painesville, Ohio, near Lake Erie on Sunday. Cameo DiChiara told CNN her car battery died, leaving her stuck at home.

“Due to the amount of snow I am unable to travel, I’m practically buried in my house,” DiChiara said, adding she has enough supplies for now.

Kathy Davis, a resident of Tug Hill in northern New York, described Saturday’s heavy snow as a “good old-fashioned winter,” in a video clip she shared with CNN affiliate WWNY.

“This is what I remember as a kid,” Davis said, according to WWNY. “It just keeps coming and coming.”

Forecasters warn of difficult travel, whiteout conditions

Highway traffic cameras showed snowy conditions over the highway in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York over the weekend.

Sima Merick, executive director of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency, warned drivers of poor visibility in a post on X.

“If you must travel, use extreme caution and give the plow driver’s plenty of room so they can do their job safely,” Merick wrote Sunday evening.

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation closed several roads in Erie County while officials continued cleanup efforts. The department reduced the speed limit to 45 miles per hour on parts of I-86 and I-90 in Erie County, while other roadways remain closed to certain types of vehicles, including school buses, tractors and motorcycles.

“Stay home, stay in place, stay safe. Only travel when necessary,” Erie County Executive Brenton Davis said at a news conference Sunday, where he described the storm as a “snowmageddon event.”

In Ohio, several roadways were closed due to debris, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation, and officials urged drivers to move carefully on slippery, snowy roads.

New York state Department of Transportation crews worked overnight to clear roadways in Chautauqua County and Jefferson County covered by heavy snow, where motorists have also been asked to stay home to give crews room to work. A ban on commercial vehicles on portions of I-90 in New York was lifted early Monday.

New York State Police helped at least 110 disabled vehicles from parts of western New York to the Pennsylvania state line between Thanksgiving and Sunday, officials said in a news release.

Two of the travelers needing help in the area were a man and his 64-year-old wife who were driving Friday for her heart transplant procedure when they became stranded in the snowstorm, according to the release.

Troopers helped get the woman to an airport away from the storm and she was flown to receive her transplant, officials said.

In the Buffalo area, the National Weather Service had an urgent message Saturday: “Delay all travel. If you must travel, drive with extreme caution.” The Buffalo region’s lake-effect snow warning continues through Monday night.

Meanwhile, with snow still falling, the Buffalo Bills’ home game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night began as scheduled after crews and volunteers earlier assisted with removing snow from the field at the open-air Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York.

The Bills on Friday began requesting help from fans to clear the field of snow ahead of game time. Workers had plenty of snow to shovel, with 24.3 inches having hit the ground by Sunday evening, according to the National Weather Service.

The wind chill in the Buffalo area Sunday evening was in the low 20s, according to the weather service.

176,NaN,Spain hotel check-in delay fears as new registration rules begin,"Spain hotel check-in delay fears as new data rules begin

The Confederation of Spanish Hoteliers and Tourist Accommodation (CEHAT) said it was concerned at the impact on its members' businesses and was considering legal action to challenge the rules.

The data required will include passport details, home addresses and methods of payment for those over the age of 14. It will be submitted to the Ministry of the Interior.

The rules, which also apply to rental properties and campsites, are being brought in for national security reasons, but tourism experts have raised privacy concerns and warned it could lead to delays at check-in desks.

Visitors to Spain will face more paperwork from Monday when a new law requiring hotel owners and car hire firms to send personal information about their customers to the government comes into effect.

Spain is the second most-popular destination for tourists in Europe, with more than 82m visitors in 2023, led by 17m from the UK.

The start date of the new rules - officially known as Royal Decree 933/2021 - was pushed back from 1 October to 2 December, to give the industry more time to prepare.

Both tourists and Spanish residents will be required to provide information, which will also include phone numbers, email addresses and the number of travellers.

Businesses will need to be registered with the Ministry of the Interior, report the data collected daily and keep a digital record of the information for three years and face fines of between €100 and €30,000 (£80-£25,000) for breaches.

Meanwhile, Airbnb has told property owners renting out accommodation through its website they will need to be registered with the Spanish government and collect data from their customers.

In a statement, the Ministry of the Interior said the regulations were ""justified for the general interest for the security of citizens against the threat of terrorism and other serious offences committed by criminal organisations"".

But the hotel industry body CEHAT said the the change “puts the viability of the sector in serious danger”.

It said both tourists and Spanish citizens will have to deal with ""complex and tedious administrative procedures, compromising their accommodation experience"".

It added hoteliers were being are forced to comply with ""confusing and disproportionate regulations"" that go against other European directives related to data protection and payment systems.

Travel journalist Simon Calder told the BBC the Spanish government was concerned about organised crime and terrorism and ""simply want to know... who's coming and going, where they are staying and what cars they are renting"".

It is expected that many accommodation and car hire providers will automate the collection of data through online registration.

Mr Calder envisaged there would be ""quite a lot of standing around at reception"" when the rules kick in but said it was ""very low season"" at the moment and that would give businesses a chance to get used to the system.

Gibraltar-based Penelope Bielckus, travel content creator at The Flyaway Girl blog, said the new rules ""add another layer of paperwork that can feel like a chore when all you want is to relax on holiday"".

And she agreed they ""might slow things down a bit, especially at check-in, since there’s now more paperwork to handle"".

But she said while Spain's level of data collection ""does feel stricter"" than elsewhere, that hotels and car hire companies already collect much of the information required from travellers.

""We’re still waiting to see how this will affect things like last-minute hotel bookings or car hire,"" she added. ""Hopefully, it won’t cause any major problems, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye on in case of any changes."""
177,NaN,Kent: High speed train derails at Ramsgate railway depot,"Train derails 'inches from family's garden'

John Horton Network Rail engineers are working to establish what caused the derailment

An investigation has been launched after a high-speed train derailed in Kent. The train was travelling at a low speed in a sidings at Ramsgate railway maintenance depot on Thursday night when it left the tracks, according to Network Rail. There were no passengers aboard the train and no reported injuries but a local resident said the train derailed ""inches"" from a family's garden fence. A spokesperson for Network Rail said an investigation is now underway to find out what caused the derailment.

Angela Anne The train was 'inches' away from a residential garden, said a resident

“An incident occurred last night in which an empty train, in the sidings at Ramsgate depot, derailed at low speed,"" the spokesperson said. ""Services are running normally through the area this morning, at a reduced speed. “There was some disruption to our services, and if any of customers were delayed then they can claim delay repay."" Rail operator Southeastern said on X at 19:25 GMT on Thursday that trains were unable to run between Ramsgate and Minster due to a safety inspection of the tracks.

John Horton The train remains near the sidings on Friday morning

Ten minutes later, they posted to say the inspection was complete and trains could run again. At 20:03, the operator said an additional safety issue had been found and that trains were halted between Ramsgate and Minster. Services resumed at 20:16 but at a slow speed, causing delays until 00:57 on Friday. It is not yet clear if the safety inspections are linked to the derailment. Southeastern was contacted for comment.

178,2024-11-29 00:00:00,Thanksgiving weekend weather: Brutal cold will grip half the US as paralyzing lake-effect snow hits the Great Lakes area,"CNN —

While ferocious snowfall threatens to trap residents in parts of the Great Lakes region, millions of holiday travelers face bitter Arctic air that will soon blast half of the entire country.

Temperatures will plunge 15 to 25 degrees across much of the eastern US over the next few days, from Minnesota all the way down to Texas.

And frigid winds over the near-record warm Great Lakes will usher in the first major lake-effect snow event of the season.

More than 6 million people under winter weather alerts could see 6 to 12 inches of snow by this weekend. The wintry blast could dump up to 5 feet of snow in places like Buffalo and Watertown, New York.

CNN Weather

“Expect dangerous travel & near whiteout conditions” Friday in northern parts of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula, the local National Weather Service office in Gaylord warned.

Holiday travelers could be stranded for days in parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. “Heavy lake-effect snow is likely to cause travel disruptions through Monday,” the NWS Weather Prediction Center said.

“A prolonged lake effect snow event will bury some areas east of both Lakes Erie and Ontario with several feet of snow today through early next week,” the NWS office in Buffalo said.

“There will be localized areas that will be paralyzed from the lake snow.”

The lake-effect snow that pummelled areas east of the Great Lakes throughout Friday left more than 2 feet of snow in some areas along Lake Erie.

Girard, Pennsylvania, recorded 25.7 inches; Conneaut, Ohio, saw 23 inches; and Erie, Pennsylvania, received 21 inches of snow.

The wind pattern responsible for the heavy snow shows no signs of changing through the weekend and some areas may end up with 4 to 6 feet of snow by Monday.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency Friday for 11 counties including Erie County, where Buffalo is located, due to the threat of lake-effect snow, she announced on X.

The New York State Thruway Authority reported snow blanketing Interstate 90 along Lake Erie on Friday afternoon as plow crews worked to clear the roads.

The heavy snow prompted county and highway officials to close portions of several roadways Friday, including parts of I-90 in New York and Pennsylvania and I-86 in Pennsylvania.

The Jefferson County, New York, sheriff’s office, near Lake Ontario, which is under a state of emergency, issued a “no unnecessary travel” advisory urging travelers to stay off the roads.

“Please stay home and stay safe,” the sheriff’s office announced on Facebook.

Tom Laird, 47, of Erie, Pennsylvania, is accustomed to snow in the winter but says the severity of Friday’s storm caught him by surprise.

“It’s been insane … nobody expected this,” he told CNN. “This kinda caught us a little off guard with how massive it’s been.”

A drive to his local grocery store for supplies, which normally takes eight minutes, took Laird about 35 minutes, he said.

During his drive, he witnessed multiple cars stalled on the side of the road and saw state troopers pulling people out.

Laird said he didn’t have any issues because his car has winter tires and four-wheel drive. The person he hired to plow the snow from his driveway and yard stopped by four times, but it was hard to tell.

“It looks like he hasn’t even been here,” said Laird, who added his yard was covered in snow again.

The combination of fierce winds and mind-numbing temperatures could be deadly in some parts of the central US.

“At the peak of the Arctic outbreak, minimum wind chills should fall below zero for much of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest,” the Weather Prediction Center said.

“Wind chills across much of the Dakotas and Minnesota will be below -15 degrees with some portions of North Dakota as cold as -30 to -40 degrees. This poses an increased risk of hypothermia and frostbite on exposed skin. Have a winter survival kit if you must travel.”

CNN Weather

For many, this wintry blast will bring the coldest temperatures since mid-February. About 70% of the country will see temperatures below freezing for the next few days.

Freeze watches are in effect for about 15 million people in states from Texas to South Carolina, with freezing temperatures expected Saturday morning.

CNN Weather

Travel will be extremely difficult or impossible with immense snow on roads and very poor visibility. The National Weather Service urged those in the hardest-hit areas to delay travel plans, if possible.

“Travel disruptions are likely, especially on I-90 between Cleveland and Buffalo and I-81 north of Syracuse,” the Weather Prediction Center warned.

Travel headaches had already begun Friday afternoon in Cattaraugus County in western New York, where traffic conditions on Route 219 were “very, very poor, with many cars and trucks off the road,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference. Cattaraugus County is also under a state of emergency.

“It is not a good time to be driving in those areas of our region,” Poloncarz said.

But aside from the Great Lakes area, no major weather-related travel nightmares are expected this weekend.

According to the National Weather Service, the storm is expected to push from the Ohio Valley and the middle of Mississippi into the Northeast region on Thanksgiving Day, making for a raining holiday for millions of Americans.

Here’s what you should know:

East Coast and Great Lakes impacts: The NWS forecasts thunderstorms will “spread into the East Coast tonight and progressively shift eastward. A swath of moderate to heavy snowfall is likely to develop across portions of the interior Northeast.” Then, in the Upper Great Lakes, 4 to 8 inches of snow showers are expected Thursday. “In the wake of this front, as temperatures cool further, lake effect snows should expand and intensify as they interact with record warm Great Lakes temperatures for so late November,” the weather service said.

Cold air: A blast of frigid Arctic air will start creeping into the northern tier of the US Wednesday and will eventually spread out to a huge part of the country through the holiday weekend. Millions coast-to-coast will be frigid by Friday. Low temperatures early Friday morning will plummet below zero in the Dakotas and drop to the teens and single digits in much of the north-central US. Many areas in the central and eastern US will face their coldest temperatures of the season over the weekend.

What about the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade? Parade marchers and spectators are in for a chilly, wet morning at this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. A Thanksgiving storm will roll through the East and spread miserable, cold rain over New York City and surrounding areas. Air temperatures will hover around 42 degrees when the parade steps off at 8:30 a.m. and rain will be ongoing. (Remember: You can get a street-side view of the biggest Thanksgiving Day parades around the country. Watch “Thanksgiving in America” on CNN and CNN Max on Thursday, November 28 at 8 a.m. ET.)

180,2024-11-22 00:00:00,Air Taxi Funding Has Stalled Over Europe — Here’s Why,"Germany-based company Volocopter 2X's air taxi is flown by test pilot Damian Hischier during a ... [+] demonstration of South Korea's Urban Air Mobility services at Gimpo International Airport in Seoul in November 11, 2021, in the first ever crewed public test flight of a fully electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air taxi in South Korea.

Europe's eVTOL flying taxi leaders are burning through cash — and investors aren't rushing to fill the gap.

So-called flying taxis are better known as eVTOLs, or electric vertical take off and landing aircraft, and have been hovering on the horizon to disrupt urban air mobility for years — pending certification of course.

But three of the biggest European players have hit financial woes of late. British Vertical Aerospace lost a key supplier, revealed net losses had climbed 45% to $17m in its latest round of annual results, and admitted it was seeking new investment — though there has been good news, with an untethered, piloted test of its VX4 aircraft.

German startup Lilium has burned through more than $1.5bn as it seeks to design an electric, vertical take-off and landing aircraft, but the German government refused a loan guarantee, sending the company into insolvency.

Fellow German firm Volocopoter also attempted to borrow from the government, failing to pin down the requested €100m, instead reportedly turning to China's Geely — which could see the manufacturing shift to China. It's since brought in a new CFO — former Lilium staffer Oliver Vogelgesang — and admitted its type certification will take until next year.

Source of European eVTOL woes

Why is it proving so difficult to get finance for eVTOL companies? Sergio Cecutta, an analyst at SMG Consulting, says it's no coincidence, and there's a simple main answer: there's not enough money sloshing around Europe. ""Raising capital in Europe, it's more difficult than raising capital in the US or China,"" he tells me.

After all, American rivals Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation have no trouble raising funds — no wonder when both companies are soaring past test flight and certification milestones, appearing increasingly ready to launch commercial services imminently, though work remains.

Cecutta says the three European companies have come on far enough in their development that they've started to ""experience some of the pains of aerospace programs that some US manufacturers or other manufacturers have not experienced yet.""

He points to Volocopter, which this summer failed to get necessary motors delivered to produce its aircraft and finish certification after Rolls-Royce pulled out of the market. That's just life in aerospace, Cecutta suggested, but it can be enough to derail a startup that doesn't have the deep pockets of more established companies.

And developing an eVTOL is an expensive prospect. Cecutta says it's likely $1.5bn to $2bn just to get fully certified, and there will be further costs to setting up an operational business. That's exacerbated by the complexity of the designs and components, given the reliance on the development of batteries that aren't yet available.

The lack of money available to even the big players in Europe suggests tougher times ahead for newer entrants to the market. ""One of the trends we've seen is money going to the companies that already have money — it's normal and typical in the startup sector to continue to fund the companies that have already accomplished certain progress,"" Cecutta says. ""The question is: if you've raised $30 million, $100 million, where is the rest of the money going to come from right? It's difficult there, unless you're bringing something very different.""

Don't blame eVTOL regulators

Regulators are often blamed for delays to future technologies, but Cecutta says that's not the case here. Instead, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has done well to get regulations in place ahead of the industry requiring them, says Cecutta.

""Now, what happens when the regulations are in place?"" he asks. ""There's no airplanes to certify.""

He adds: ""The regulator did a great job, but the companies didn't follow through with that.""

In the meantime, the US continues to lead the eVTOL market, Cecutta says, with leader Joby Aviation already filing for certification in the UK. Plus, he added, China is making ""progress at a pace that is unheard of in the West.""

If the European eVTOL manufacturers do fail to deliver, that could leave Europe as a key battleground for products: the US will be dominated by local firms, says Cecutta, while the lower prices of Chinese models will offer inroads in key markets in Asia and the Middle East, he predicts, saying it's similar to the electric vehicle market. But without a homegrown hero, Europe could be where US and Chinese models truly compete for market share.

Real danger for European eVTOLs?

But don't yet count out Europe's eVTOL market. All three companies are still operational, seeking solutions to their various funding issues. UK-based Vertical Aerospace hadn't responded to a request for comment at the time of writing, but the BBC suggested a deal worth $75m in investment was imminent.

A spokesperson for Lilium told me the company was speaking to investors and considering M&A options, adding that though the company is in insolvency, work was continuing with plans in place for a first flight in early 2025. The spokesperson noted that the failure to win a loan guarantee from the German government wasn't down to Lilium's technology, but instead was blamed on disagreement in parliament from the Green Party over funding an air travel company. The German government has since collapsed.

Volocopter also reportedly failed to raise €100m from the German government in April — perhaps the eVTOL woes have as much to do with German politics than anything else — and a report from Bloomberg suggested Chinese giant Geely may step in.

In an email, Volocopter told me it was constantly working with multiple private investors on funding, given it remains a pre-revenue, private company. ""It is not just the eVTOL market or EU that is having difficulties raising capital,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, the global market has been extremely tough and a completely different landscape since 2020/2021.""

But overall, these financial struggles are not a good sign for the eVTOL market, says Cecutta. ""These internal troubles that they're having when it comes to funding and investors… does not bode well,"" Cecutta adds. ""When it comes to startups, you have to be all hands pushing in the same direction. When you begin to have issues with company control and investors, it doesn't make things easier."""
181,2024-11-22 21:53:27.367000+00:00,"What to do if your luggage is lost, delayed, stolen or damaged","Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.

CNN —

It’s enough to give anyone already on edge about how to handle possible flight delays and cancellations yet another reason to pop an antacid or two: the prospect of delayed, lost, stolen or damaged baggage.

The concern is valid, especially during peak winter holiday travel and situations such as the global IT outage in the summer of 2024. Handing over checked suitcases can almost feel like a leap of faith these days.

Yet you’re not totally powerless. There are things you can do and strategies you can take to help avoid losing a bag or at least minimize the impact of delayed, lost, stolen and damaged luggage.

Before you go to the airport

Book nonstop flights: If you’re really concerned about your checked luggage, prioritize nonstop flights or at least layovers with a generous amount of time, said Scott Keyes, the founder of flight deals and travel advice site Going.com.

“Bags are most likely to get lost in that transfer between planes at connection, especially if there’s a tight connection.” And he said that’s doubly so for international flights with tight connections.

Take pictures of your luggage and its contents: Jo Hoban, a travel agent in Spanish Fork, Utah, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City, told CNN Travel that she advises her clients to “take a picture of their bags because the first things airline offices will ask you is what is the brand name of the bag, what is the color of the bag, the size of the bag and the contents of the bag.”

She also said people should lay out what they are planning to pack on the bed and take a picture of that, too. If the bag is lost, that helps create a content record.

Use baggage tracking: Many airline apps allow travelers to see the status of their bags in real time, showing when they are checked, loaded onto the plane and offloaded.

You can set up independent tracking yourself. For extra safety, you can set up your own bag-tracking. CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, has recommendations. And travelers using Apple AirTags will soon be able to allow third-party access to tracking information, giving airports and airlines another tool to hunt for bags in real time.

Properly ID your suitcases on the inside, too: The consumer advocate group Travelers United says put your info on the inside, too, in case your outside tag gets torn off.

The power of carry-ons: The airlines can’t lose baggage you never check in. Paula Twidale, senior vice president of travel for AAA, suggests packing as light as you can and using just carry-ons. You’ll save time leaving the airport and have more peace of mind.

Review your credit card coverage: Before you buy extra travel insurance, Keyes suggested you check your credit card policy for travel protection. You might get supplemental compensation (for what the airlines don’t cover) not only for lost bags, but also for reimbursements for things you may need to buy while you’re waiting for your luggage.

Luggage shipping: Shipping your luggage separately could make sense for two types of trips, Keyes said.

First case: You’re going to live somewhere for a month or longer and planning to bring a lot of stuff. Shipping not only allows you to bring more but at a cheaper price. And you get door-to-door service instead of carrying heavy bags around the airport.

Second case: You’ve got several short stopovers ahead of a final destination where you plan to stay a good bit longer. Use carry-ons for the short hops; ship your big luggage to the final stop.

If you’re shipping to a hotel or Airbnb, confirm with the staff or owner that they can store your belongings until you arrive, Keyes said.

Consider discount airlines: Keyes said full-service airlines are more likely to lose your bags than the discount airlines, which tend to have more nonstop flights that have a lower likelihood of losing a bag in transit.

He said he wouldn’t make a booking decision based solely on this, but it’s “an interesting side factor to consider.”

At the airport before you fly

Check your bags in a timely manner: Advocacy group Travelers United says last-minute baggage check-ins can lead to a greater chance of trouble.

“Don’t push the system. The smallest delay can have serious consequences when your luggage is cruising down the conveyor belt and selected for security examination with little time to spare,” its website says.

Keep valuables in your carry-on: The TSA urges travelers to keep valuables such as jewelry with them in the cabin. “Do not put them in checked baggage,” the agency’s website says. And Keyes advises taking a picture of your packed luggage.

Check your baggage tag’s destination: Travelers United also advises you double-check your airline luggage tags and make sure they’re going to where you are going, especially if you’re doing curbside check-in.

And the North Carolina Consumers Council reminds travelers to keep their baggage claim ticket or sticker.

If your baggage is delayed

Scope out other spots at the airport: If your suitcases aren’t on the designated pick-up carousel, The Points Guy travel advice website suggests checking nearby carousels. If you don’t see them there, try the airline’s baggage office. This is also a good time to put those aforementioned tracking apps to work.

Report your issue and fill out forms at the airport: If your bags haven’t shown up, let the airline know.

“Many times, airline personnel will explain that the luggage has been located but will be delayed until the next flight,” Travelers United says. “If you have the time, wait. If not, fill out the appropriate lost luggage forms at the airport.”

Let the airline deliver your bags: Keyes said if an airline can locate your suitcases but it’s going to be hours before they arrive, make sure the reps have the address where you’ll be and use the airline’s delivery service.

Keep receipts: “If you buy anything to get you through the days without your luggage — from a new swimsuit to toothpaste — keep the receipts. You may need these to get reimbursed,” Going.com advises.

If your luggage is lost, damaged or stolen

Check your airline’s claims and compensation policy: Each airline should have website information on what to do if your bag is lost. For example, this is Delta Air Lines’ page. This is American Airlines’ page. And this is Southwest Airlines’ page. And airlines based outside the United States have their own systems. This is what to do if flying British Airways or Lufthansa.

If the airline isn’t being helpful: “If the airline is dragging its feet on compensation … don’t be afraid to complain to the Department of Transportation, Keyes said regarding US airlines. You can file a complaint here.

For information on making claims for UK flights, click here. And check the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority’s site here. Get more information on Canadian flights here.

Liability limits: There’s fine print, exceptions and paperwork/documentation hurdles, but you should eventually get cash for your lost bags.

For US domestic flights, the maximum liability amount allowed by DOT regulation is $3,800. Airlines are free to pay more than the limit but are not required to do so. Find out more from the DOT here. For international flights, that figure is about $1,700.

Damaged bags: If you see your luggage is damaged while still at the airport, report it there. Airlines aren’t required to pay for damages to items caused by improper packing, according to the DOT, nor are they responsible for “certain categories of items (for example: fragile items, electronics, cash, perishable items …)” They are liable for damage to wheels, handles and straps.

Insurance: Baggage insurance can generally be divided into two broad categories: baggage delay and baggage loss. CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, has a guide covering baggage insurance."

getty

As we approach the 2024 holiday season, businesses—particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—must prepare for a time of both heightened opportunity and potential challenges. The National Retail Federation expects consumers to spend 2.5% to 3.5% more this holiday season than they did last year.

To succeed during this critical period, companies need to be aware of key trends, anticipate shifts in consumer behavior and equip themselves to handle increased demand. By focusing on flexibility, operational readiness and customer satisfaction, businesses could find great success while mitigating risks. Here’s what businesses need to know to ensure a successful holiday season.

Prepare for increased demand and flexibility in operations.

The holiday season, especially during events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, brings a significant surge in e-commerce activity. In fact, based on my company's internal data, we forecast a volume increase of over 40% compared to regular operating days, with peak days like December 23 expected to see a 50% rise in shipments.

To handle this surge, businesses need to ensure their supply chains can flexibly scale up operations. Whether it’s managing inventory, scheduling extra delivery fleets or hiring additional staff, operational flexibility will be key to meeting customer expectations.

Monitor global supply chain challenges.

Supply chain disruptions can create headaches during peak season, and businesses must stay ahead of potential issues. From unpredictable weather patterns to last-minute changes in consumer behavior, external factors can lead to capacity constraints and delays.

Businesses should closely monitor their supply chains and work with logistics providers who can offer agile solutions, such as additional shipping capacity or alternative transportation routes. Leaders should engage in regular dialogue with logistics partners to understand emerging risks and align on contingency plans. Emphasizing real-time data sharing can also improve responsiveness and make adjustments easier as conditions evolve.

To be able to adapt quickly to unexpected changes while maintaining high levels of service quality, businesses should also cultivate a network of reliable providers and consider diverse transportation options.

Focus on customer experience and communication.

Today’s consumers have high expectations, particularly during the holiday season when timely delivery and seamless experiences are essential. A recent survey from Radial reveals that 29% of consumers now anticipate receiving holiday orders within two to three days.

Businesses must prioritize clear communication, especially around shipping deadlines, delivery delays or potential stock shortages. Providing transparency and offering customers multiple delivery options—such as expedited shipping or flexible return policies—can go a long way in building trust and retaining loyalty.

Additionally, SMEs should take a proactive approach to managing customer stress during this busy time. Offering responsive customer service, including access to support channels like live chat or social media, can help mitigate frustration and enhance the overall shopping experience.

Leverage e-commerce and international growth.

Despite global economic challenges, many SMEs remain optimistic about the potential for e-commerce growth during the holiday season. In fact, many of the companies in my company's 2024 E-Commerce Survey expect their e-commerce sales to increase year-over-year, with social commerce expected to reach approximately $2 trillion by 2025. Moreover, international growth presents a significant opportunity, with markets like the EU, UK, Mexico and Canada offering new customer bases for businesses to tap into.

Diversifying into international markets not only opens revenue streams but also helps businesses spread risk by reducing reliance on one region. Companies should consider adjusting their marketing strategies to target international audiences and ensure they are prepared to navigate cross-border logistics and compliance.

Incorporate sustainable solutions.

Sustainability is becoming increasingly important to consumers, especially during the holiday season when shopping spikes. Another recent study from my company found that 59% of U.S. online shoppers consider sustainability ""very"" or ""quite"" important. This presents a unique challenge during peak season, when businesses must manage heightened demand while aligning with consumer values.

By offering transparency around sustainability efforts and providing greener packaging and delivery options businesses can differentiate themselves in a crowded market. During the holidays, when shipping volumes soar, incorporating sustainable practices not only supports the environment but also strengthens customer loyalty, as consumers gravitate towards brands that reflect their values.

Stay agile in a volatile environment.

The holiday season is filled with unpredictability, from sudden changes in consumer demand to supply chain disruptions. Businesses must remain agile and ready to pivot when needed. Partnering with logistics providers that can offer scalable solutions, such as additional aircraft or trucking rotations, will be vital to staying on top of fluctuating volumes.

In a rapidly changing market, businesses need to be ready for anything—whether it’s higher-than-expected volumes or global trade volatility. By staying informed, prepared and adaptable, companies can make the most of the holiday season and position themselves for long-term success.

184,NaN,Business leader criticises 'farcical' Jersey ferry contract delay,"Business criticises 'farcical' ferry contract delay

BBC The Government of Jersey has offered Condor Ferries an extension to its current contract

Business leaders have criticised the delay in deciding on a new ferry contract for the Channel Islands. The States of Guernsey confirmed Brittany Ferries as its preferred bidder on 30 October, but Jersey's government has not yet made its decision. Simon De La Rue, from the Little Big Brew craft brewery in Guernsey and part of the Guernsey Tourism Partnership, said it was ""farcical"" and ""doesn't bring certainty to the following season"". Condor's parent company, Brittany Ferries, said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by Jersey government's offer of a seven-month extension to its contract.

Mark Cox said the financial information about the companies in the tender process should have been available before now

Jersey's government said one reason for the delay was it needed to make sure the next operator was expected to be financially stable for the next 15 years. Mark Cox, the chief executive of the Channel Islands Coop, said if Condor accepted the extension, it would offer ""some certainty"" for the supermarket chain. He said: ""In entering any tender process, you would always look at that financial stability, and what are you looking for from an output point of view and can those people that are adopting the tender deliver those outputs? ""And if they can't, then they shouldn't be in the tender process. ""That finance information should have been available well before now.""

'Extension is so short'

Mr De La Rue said he would be surprised if Brittany Ferries accepted the Condor extension. ""It doesn't bring certainty to the following season, given that the offer of a seven-month extension is so short,"" he told BBC Radio Guernsey. He said: ""We really need to be looking at building our inter-island connectivity with Jersey, that will help out the tourism sectors of both islands. ""A healthy tourism sector in Jersey is a positive thing for Guernsey."" Mr De La Rue added: ""It's relatively farcical that you can go through an eight-month tender process and then ask for a seven-month extension. ""I don't see why you should be doing that with a ferry contract that affects the lives of 200,000 plus people.""

Robert Mackenzie said the tourism element was not being given ""quite the same attention and focus"" as freight

Robert Cornelius, from the Guernsey Motor Trade Association, said: ""I think businesses that rely on getting goods from the UK to the islands just need to see a reliable, consistent, regular service. ""But we also understand, because we're businesses, that there's a cost involved with that, and things have to be viable."" Robert Mackenzie, managing director of CI Travel Group, said the government still valued other parts of the economy more than tourism. He said: ""This contract is really more about freight and about providing lifeline services to the island in terms of food delivery and other supplies. ""The visitor passenger side of it, while important, is not being given quite the same attention and focus.""

Deputy Karen Wilson said questions would be asked in the States Assembly next week

Deputy Karen Wilson, a member of the Economic and International Affairs Scrutiny Panel, said: ""We are intending to make sure that in the Assembly next week there will be questions asked about what has gone on. ""But one of the most important things at the moment is that we have got to make sure that whatever happens through this next couple of weeks, and by the end of December, that we do have a decision that is in the interest of Jersey."" Previously, Deputy Kirsten Morel, who is overseeing the tender process for Jersey, asked islanders to ""please trust me"". He said: ""I am in a difficult position. I need to find financially resilient ferry services for our island. ""That financial resilience is all about being able to invest in a new fleet and being able to continue for the 15 years of the contract.""

Guernsey's Committee for Economic Development said it would evaluate the Guernsey-only approach on Brittany Ferries and would finalise a contract in the next 10 days. Brittany Ferries chief executive, Christophe Matthieu, said the firm had provided enough information for the government to make a decision on the 15-year contract.

185,2024-11-08 00:00:00,Canada’s West Coast Port Strike Causes Supply Chain Panic,"The West Coast ports handle about $576 million in daily trade and play a vital role in North America’s interconnected ports, railways, and trucking. However, a prolonged strike could throw a wrench in this well-oiled machine, causing ripple effects throughout the entire supply chain. getty

The holiday season is fast approaching. But this year’s excitement could be dampened by the threat of major trade disruptions due to ongoing port strikes, once again.

British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (BCMEA) locked out over 700 foremen at ports across British Columbia. This disruption coincides with an ongoing strike at the Port of Montreal - the largest port in eastern Canada - which has been already facing partial closures affecting 40% of its container traffic.

It’s not hard to see how shipping backlogs could pile up, which could potentially disrupt the important international shipments, causing serious economic headaches for businesses and consumers.

The ripple effect of the strike

The West Coast ports are a powerhouse, handling about $576 million in daily trade and playing a vital role in North America’s network of ports, railways, and trucking. However, a prolonged strike could throw a wrench in this well-oiled machine, causing ripple effects throughout the entire supply chain.

History serves as a reminder: Last month, a three-day strike involving over 47,000 dockworkers affected 36 U.S. ports, and while it was brief, the resulting backlog of ships waiting to unload cargo is expected to disrupt local and international supply chains for weeks.

Forbes Drug Shortages Create Surprising Opportunity For Pharma Supply Chain

With cargo activities already affected, vital international shipments are at risk, which could lead to significant economic losses for various industries. This situation may worsen shipping backlogs and bottlenecks for businesses, driving up transportation costs and potentially leading to shutdowns of plants and mills that depend on shipping to get their products out the door.

It’s not just the big players who will feel the heat. The small and medium-sized businesses are likely to be hit hardest due to lack of flexibility in contracts comparing to larger companies, making them more vulnerable to increased costs and delays when shipment plans change.

For distributors serving multiple retailers, even a small delay can mean they can’t meet their contractual obligations, which could lead to penalties.

While consumers might not notice immediate shortages on grocery shelves or in stores, if this labor dispute drags on for weeks, they may soon feel the impact as costs rise and availability dips.

Supply chain strategies behind fully stocked shelves

As this is not the first nor the last supply chain disruption, leveraging supply chain best practices is essential for effectively navigating these challenges. Here are what companies can do in a long and in a short time:

Enhancing visibility is essential for making informed and agile decisions. Rising costs linked to backlog are just one concern; unforeseen incidents can also occur. Because who would imagine a lithium-ion battery caused a fire after an overturned tractor trailer, which burned for several days and temporarily closed the ports? But with enhanced visibility companies can make quick and informed decisions to mitigate the impact of such unexpected events.

Forbes Digital Supply Chains: Bridging The Gap Between Vision And Reality

By integrating scenario planning, organizations can develop tailored strategic responses for various scenarios by analyzing historical data on strikes and other disruptions to understand their potential causes.

Re-routing and alternative shipping methods are widely used strategy. During US port strike in October, the Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd implemented local port surcharges for cargo moving to and from affected terminals. Some shipping lines began rerouting vessels to alternative ports, which resulted in longer transit times and additional shipping costs – but at least no disappointed customers. Instead of only using ocen freight, shifting to air cargo were it is feasable is a quick solution.

Cross-functional and clear communication is crucial in times of uncertainty because no business can do it alone. Providing regular updates about potential delays can help manage expectations and maintain customer relationships. Clear communication is crucial in times of uncertainty, ensuring that both suppliers and customers are informed about the situation. After all, who wants to see their order stuck in the same status for two weeks without any updates?

Inventory optimization strategies help buffer against supply chain interruptions by determining optimal stock levels for essential parts and products. By leveraging advanced and AI-driven demand forecasting tools, companies can better predict consumer needs and strategically position inventory closer to customers – so even if primary distribution channels are disrupted, businesses can fulfill orders quickly.

Behind those fully stocked shelves lies a network of well-balanced long- and short-term strategies that make it all possible. By taking proactive steps to mitigate the impact of strikes and such events, businesses can not only protect their interests but also contribute to a more stable and resilient supply chain ecosystem.

186,NaN,"Mystery parcel fires were 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US, says Poland","Mystery fires were Russian 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US

Getty Images Germany's domestic intelligence says it was a stroke of fortune that a device in Leipzig had not ignited in mid-air (file pic)

A series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada, Polish prosecutors say. Katarzyna Calow-Jaszewska revealed late last month that four people had been arrested and authorities across Europe were investigating the incidents. Western security officials have now told US media they believe the fires - which happened in July - were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage. But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic.

Ms Calow-Jaszewska said in a statement that a group of foreign intelligence saboteurs had been involved in sending parcels containing hidden explosives and dangerous materials via courier companies. The parcels then spontaneously burst into flames or blew up. Western officials believe the fires originated in electric massage machines containing a ""magnesium-based"" substance. Magnesium-based fires are hard to put out, especially on board a plane. “The group’s goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada,” Ms Calow-Jaszewska said. Some of the devices originated in Lithuania, and prosecutor general Nida Grunskiene said there had been arrests there too. A pre-trial investigation was under way and law enforcement agencies from other countries were taking part, she told reporters. On three days in July, fires broke out in a container due to be loaded on to a DHL cargo plane in the German city of Leipzig, at a transport company near Warsaw, and at Minworth near Birmingham, UK, involving a package described as an incendiary device. The incident at Jablonow near Warsaw took two hours to extinguish, according to Polish reports. UK officials have given few details about the fire at Midpoint Way in Minworth on 22 July. A Met Police spokesperson confirmed that a counter-terrorism investigation was under way after a package at a commercial premises caught alight, adding that ""it was dealt with by staff and the local fire brigade"". Ken McCallum, head of the UK's domestic intelligence agency MI5, said last month that Russian secret agents had carried out ""arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness"" after the UK had helped Ukraine in Russia's war. His allegations were flatly rejected by the Kremlin. A spokesperson for the US Transportation Security Administration said in recent months they have put in place additional security measures for certain US-bound cargo flown in by US and foreign airlines. A US government official also added that there is no current active threat targeting US-bound flights."

CNN —

Bad weather. Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled.

It’s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time – or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not).

Here’s some advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled.

Before you go to the airport

Check the status of your flight before you head to the airport. If your flight has been canceled, you could save yourself the hassle of a trip to a busy airport. Pattarisara Suvichanarakul/iStockphoto/Getty Images

As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.

“Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.”

Other tips from Keyes:

Sign up for airlines’ free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. Also, download your carrier’s app.

Put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the flight status that way.

Check the website FlightAware for larger flight trends across the country.

Hop on waiver offers ahead of bad weather quickly. Early birds have the best choices of the remaining seats and flights.

If you’re at the airport already

Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do?

Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.

Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. It might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said.

Other tactics you can try:

Go to a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines and United Airlines advise.

Use social media to your advantage, the travel advice website Travel Lens suggests. Try contacting the airline via X or other platforms when calls aren’t going through.

Try an international call center for your carrier, Keyes suggests. Calls to US domestic numbers might have longer waits.

Attitude and research matter

Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference.

“Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”

He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”

Other considerations:

Book directly with an airline if the price is the same. If you’ve booked through a third-party site, you’ll have to deal through them when there’s a cancellation.

Avoid layovers when booking if possible, the consumer advocacy group US PIRG suggests. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong.

Regarding tarmac delays, airlines must provide working bathrooms the entire time, US PIRG says. “After two hours, you must have food and water. After three hours, you must be in the air or back in the airport – or the airline faces massive fines.”

Help from other airlines

Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.

“When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.

“This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”

Frequent flyer miles

Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of Points Path, told CNN Travel in an email

“You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them. But you could save yourself some significant cash if you’re trying to evacuate away from a storm,” Kheel said.

“Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.

“But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.”

Trapped for the night

What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?

“Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It’s not required by law,” Keyes said. They’re less likely to do it there’s a weather issue, he said.

Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.

Other things to consider:

Book your flight with a credit card, Smith said: “Many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.”

Consider hunkering down at the airport rather than going to and from a hotel if your flight is delayed but not canceled. A lot depends on your personal comfort level and the estimated wait time, Keyes said.

Check whether there is a hotel room available within the airport.

Try getting into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily, the Points Guy advises.

Make safety your No. 1 priority. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous, Keyes warns.

Travel insurance and receipts

Talk to an expert about whether it's a good idea to purchase travel insurance. And research what kind of coverage you might get from your credit card, too. Poike/iStockphoto/Getty Images

Consider buying travel insurance, advised Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel.

It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.”

The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.

New automatic refunds in the US

Airlines in the United States are now required to give passengers cash refunds if their flight is significantly delayed or canceled, even if that person does not explicitly ask for a refund.

The Department of Transportation says the final federal rule requiring that airlines dole out refunds — not vouchers — went into effect on October 28, 2024. Find out the details here."

A commercial move is a complex endeavor that demands an extremely high level of efficiency. Even the slightest misstep can have a huge ripple effect, impacting a company’s ability to serve and support its customers. Every minute of unanticipated downtime resulting from issues that evolve during a move can translate to lost income and reputational damage.

As a software development professional with nearly two decades of experience in enterprise solutions and mobile app development, I have applied my practical and results-oriented approach to business to create personalized logistics and delivery services utilizing AI to optimize routes and provide businesses with the fastest, most efficient last-mile delivery resource possible. I've found that utilizing a blend of technology, transparency and data-driven expertise can help commercial moving companies achieve maximum efficiency.

It's critical to understand the stakes and know what it takes to streamline the process and avoid unexpected costs and delays. By developing a comprehensive and dynamic moving strategy that considers every unique factor, you can better prepare so that you leave nothing to chance.

The Challenges Of Commercial Moving

The primary challenge commercial movers must overcome is the proper and efficient handling of bulky items. To maximize efficiency, movers must be experienced with best practices for transporting items in and out of buildings and vehicles. In addition to being bulky, commercial items can often be fragile. Office equipment can include servers, printers, computers and other items that require special handling.

Sequencing is another challenge that must be addressed in commercial moving. The more precise moving companies can be in their loading and unloading of office or industrial components, the more quickly they can be redeployed in their new locations. Experienced commercial movers orchestrate moves in a way that ensures the right equipment is available at the right time.

When certain types of technology are involved in a move, coordination becomes another challenge that must be addressed. A successful commercial move often involves the efforts of professionals other than movers, such as those setting up servers, reassembling office furniture or connecting printers and other tech tools. To avoid delays, the moving company must keep those teams updated on the progress of the move.

The Role Of Technology In Modern Moving Solutions

Technology plays a huge role in the high levels of efficiency today’s commercial movers can achieve. Every step of the process—from determining fees to identifying routes to updating clients on progress—benefits from the use of modern technology solutions.

Flexibility and personalization are crucial benefits today’s technology brings to the world of commercial moving. Each move has its unique needs in terms of timelines, items that must be moved and challenges that must be overcome. Data-driven systems also empower transparent pricing to ensure costs are understood and approved before the move begins. This helps provide the details needed to make a fair comparison.

Harnessing The Power Of AI

Artificial intelligence is helping to empower greater levels of business efficiency in virtually every sector. In commercial moving, AI can help streamline inventory management, transport and communication.

By optimizing the movers' inventory management process, AI helps ensure companies have the resources available to meet client needs. This can include empowering demand forecasting, which draws upon economic indicators and other data to anticipate needs. As seen with companies like Microsoft, GE Digital and many others, AI can also drive intelligent packing, which involves gathering data from pictures of what needs to be moved to compile a list of materials that will be required.

Route optimization is another critical component of moving efficiency that benefits from AI, allowing companies like Amazon to offer same-day shipping for consumers. Analyzing data to determine the optimal route for transportation vehicles speeds up the move, reducing the time companies must be in transition. Route optimization also reduces fuel use and wear and tear on vehicles, which saves money for moving companies.

AI-driven systems enhance route optimization by providing dynamic updates to routing. If new data, such as changes to traffic or weather, impacts route efficiency, AI can automatically identify a new route and share it with transportation teams. Such real-time updates ensure travel efficiency is constantly optimized.

In addition to updating transport teams on modified routes, AI can also empower dynamic communication with clients. By providing real-time updates on the estimated time of arrival, companies can better ensure teams and other resources will be available and prepared to engage with movers once they reach their destination. Technology-enhanced communication systems can also support updates flowing from clients, letting movers know when access protocols are updated.

Stepping Into Modernized Commercial Moving

As companies seek to improve the efficiency of their moving operations by adopting the enhancements explored above, there are several steps they should take to evaluate their readiness. The first involves assessing whether or not they have the equipment and expertise needed to safely and strategically move today’s high-tech office equipment.

To leverage the power of AI for data analytics, companies need to have systems in place that bring all relevant data points together on one platform. Siloed systems prevent AI from conducting a comprehensive evaluation. Companies that want to conduct predictive analysis, such as demand forecasting, will need to give AI platforms access to historical data.

Optimizing user interfaces for both customers and employees is also an important step toward empowering efficient operations. Consumer-facing interfaces should provide transparency, flexibility and a high level of user control, enabling potential customers to explore a variety of options and providing the information needed to ensure moves are handled correctly. Employee-facing interfaces should make it easy for drivers and customer service representatives to receive and respond to notifications such as route updates or customer concerns.

Conclusion

For commercial moving, achieving maximum efficiency requires much more than transportation. Solutions should consider every aspect of the move, leveraging technology and informed strategies to empower a seamless transition. When approached strategically, the result is reduced downtime and the peace of mind that all equipment is transported with precision and moved in accordance with predetermined timelines.

192,NaN,Storm Darragh Wales: Pub's big losses as thousands without power,"Pub's big storm loss as thousands without power

BBC Pub landlord Nils Kirk says the power cut after Storm Darragh has been a ""massive knock"" to the business

A pub landlord says a power cut during Storm Darragh has cost the business at least £15,000 so far. Nils Kirk, who runs The Ancient Briton pub in Powys, said he was ""gutted"" to have lost nearly 300 reservations at their busiest time of the year, after the power outage on Saturday. The pub is one of thousands of businesses and homes in Wales which remain without power after Storm Darragh swept across large parts of the UK at the weekend.

""This is the time of year we need to make money"", he said, adding that this came at an already difficult time for the hospitality industry due to the rise in utility costs. ""It's a massive knock. I'm gutted for the staff, they need money for Christmas,"" he added. Mr Kirk said the pub in Penycae, Ystradgynlais, had 150 people booked in for lunch and Christmas parties on Saturday and another 130 on Sunday. The power cut also meant that the pub's phone and mobile phone signal were out of action, with staff struggling to get hold of customers.

A caravan at a site in Carmarthenshire was crushed by a large tree brought down during Storm Darragh

Winds of up to 93mph (150km/h) battered large parts of the country, and a rare red warning was in place for much of the coast on Saturday. Cardiff council said the storm brought down more trees in the city in one night than over the past 20 years, with reports of more than 189 affected. As of 22:00 GMT, the Wales total without power is 21,422. National Grid said there are 17,226 properties without power across south and mid Wales, with Scottish Power reporting about 4,196 outages across north and mid Wales. Welsh Water reported that some residents in the Aberystwyth, Rhayader and Llandrindod Wells area of Powys were without water or with low pressure due to power cuts affecting pumps. It said these issues are expected to be fixed later.

Some train services and ferry sailings have also been affected, with Holyhead Port closed and scheduled sailings to Dublin cancelled ""due to infrastructure weather damage"". A port spokesperson said a ""thorough assessment"" was being carried out after the damage on Saturday morning and it is expected to remain closed until 18:00 on Tuesday at the earliest.

A number of shipping containers at a site in Dowlais Top, Merthyr Tydfil, were overturned by the storm

Transport for Wales (TfW) said all railway lines were blocked on 11 routes, including Swansea to Milford Haven, Swansea to Shrewsbury, and Chester to Holyhead. TfW also warned people to check before they travel on a number of routes. National Rail Enquiries said ""services may be busier than normal today and experience severe overcrowding"".

Some SP Energy Network customers in north and mid Wales have been told their power will not be restored until 21:00 GMT

Hawarden High School Hawarden High School in Flintshire is closed for structural assessment after the gable end of the listed building collapsed during the storm

School closures

Dozens of schools across Wales were closed or partially closed, including in Bridgend, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Gwynedd, Anglesey and Flintshire. Ceredigion council said its teams had been out clearing trees on main roads over the weekend, advising that it may be some time before they are able to clear other roads. It also opened a number of drop-in centres where those without power can have showers, charge phones and keep warm.

Huw Rees Huw Rees says when you are on dialysis or have kidney problems, ""the cold is a big deal - you're always cold""

One of those affected by the loss of power is fashion presenter Huw ""Fash"" Rees, who is dependent on electricity to receive kidney dialysis. Mr Rees, from Brynamman, Carmarthenshire, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast that he had been without power all weekend and he had to go to hospital on Sunday night to have blood tests, followed by dialysis on Monday. ""When you don't get dialysis, all the toxins stay in the body,"" he said. Mr Rees said he was ""very hopeful"" the electricity supply would return soon. He called for better planning for people who depend on power supplies for their health, saying he had not yet received a call from the electricity board offering help, even though he is on a priority list because he is vulnerable.

193,2024-12-09 05:00:00,Navigating promotional pricing for increased customer engagement,"Navigating promotional pricing for increased customer engagement

Customers love promotions. Think about it: there’s nothing better than seeing that your grocery store is having a BOGO sale on your favorite cereal. Is the deal ‘limited time only’? Before you know it, you’re probably stocking up on items you weren’t even intending to buy.

As suppliers, promotional pricing comes with its own challenges. While it’s a great strategy to adopt when you’re looking for increased sales, a competitive edge or better brand awareness, promotional pricing is not without some risks. To do it right, there are a few things that suppliers should keep in mind.

What is promotional pricing for suppliers, and why should my brand do it?

Promotional pricing is a strategy that suppliers use to achieve a specific business goal. That goal varies depending on the current supplier strategy.

Boosting sales

When suppliers want to increase their sales in a short period of time, promotional pricing can attract more customers and encourage them to make purchases they may otherwise delay or skip.

Inventory management

Suppliers may use promotional pricing when they have excess inventory, especially for old or seasonal items.

Market penetration

Lower prices can help suppliers reach new markets and are a good starting point for acquiring new customers.

Competitive edge

When there’s a lot of competition, suppliers can use promotions to gain an edge in the market and increase market share, especially with customers who are more sensitive to high prices.

Enhancing retailer relationships

Promotional pricing with retailers strengthens relationships and could lead to more shelf space, more favorable terms and more opportunities for collaboration.

Customer loyalty

Suppliers who offer discounts are more likely to see repeat customers who appreciate a good deal. If suppliers do promotional pricing with any type of regularity, customers may develop a preference for that brand.

This all sounds great. Why would any supplier not want to offer promotional pricing from time to time?

As with any good supply chain strategy, promotional pricing can be a complex process to get right. Eroded profit margins, brand devaluation and unrealistic customer expectations are just a few of the risks associated with promotional pricing that’s done incorrectly.

Risk #1: Eroded profit margins

If suppliers offer promotional pricing too often with no significant increase in sales volume, they run the risk of eroding their profit margins.

Risk #2: Brand devaluation

Constant promotions can lead customers to believe that the brand is low quality or make the decision to only purchase items when there is a discount.

Risk #3: Operational strain

When suppliers offer promotional pricing, they will most likely see sudden spikes in demand. Without the proper supply chain setup, however, they may struggle to keep up with the influx of orders.

Risk #4: Inventory shortages

When promotional pricing is too successful, it can lead to inventory shortages, which disappoints customers and damages the supplier’s reputation.

Risk #5: Market oversaturation

If there’s too much promotional pricing, the market becomes saturated, which makes it difficult for suppliers to generate interest in future promotions.

How can suppliers navigate promotional pricing in a way that works with their supply chain strategy?

Though the line between good promotional pricing and bad promotional pricing can be thin, there are some strategies that are available to help suppliers decide when and how to offer discounts. It’s important for suppliers to zero in on exactly what they’re looking to gain by offering promotional prices.

First, suppliers should analyze historical data of past promotions by looking at inventory levels, promotional prices, discount percentages and sales lift to create a solid sales plan for the next promotion.

Collaboration with trading partners should be another priority for any supplier looking to offer discounted prices. They’ll be able to confirm inventory quantities and demand to ensure the correct promotional pricing is offered.

Once the promotion is running, it should drive customers into the store to purchase the items at a discount while also leaving with other items in their basket.

With the help of the right technology, you can find the perfect balance for promotional pricing with capabilities like analyzed and actionable sell-through data insights, streamlined item, pricing and other data, and inventory visibility for trading partners.

195,2024-12-09 00:00:00,Descartes Releases December Global Shipping Report: November 2024 U.S. Container Imports Show Softer Seasonal Decline,"ATLANTA —

Georgia, December 9, 2024 -- Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq: DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, released its December Global Shipping Report for logistics and supply chain professionals. In November 2024, U.S. container import volume decreased 5% from October 2024, which is consistent with seasonal month-over-month declines seen in previous years, though smaller than the 9% decrease over the same period in 2023. Imports from China also declined, though November volumes are 13.3% higher than the same month in 2023, underscoring the continued strength of U.S.–China trade. The December update of the logistics metrics monitored by Descartes continues to demonstrate the strong performance of container imports in 2024; however, the potential introduction of new tariffs by the incoming Trump administration, stalled ILA/USMX contract negotiations, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East may put pressure on global supply chains throughout the balance of the year.

At 2,368,758 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), November U.S. container import volume dipped for the first time in four months below 2.4 million TEUs—a level that previously led to port congestion and delays during the pandemic. Versus November 2023, volume in November 2024 was higher by 12.8%, and up a significant 24.6% from pre-pandemic November 2019. Notably, total imports for the first 11 months (25,829,192 TEUs) of 2024 have already surpassed the 12-month total (24,957,640 TEUs) for 2023—by 871,552 TEUs or 3.5%.

“November has traditionally been a softer month than October; however, compared to the past six years, this year’s month-over-month decline is the smallest by volume (down 125,877 TEUs)” said Jackson Wood, Director, Industry Strategy at Descartes. “While front-loading shipments due to heightened uncertainty around labor unrest and tariffs is a possibility, U.S. container import volumes have been exceptionally strong over peak season this year and, overall, robust throughout 2024.”

197,2024-12-09 16:54:00,Canada Post strike: What shippers should know,"Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Canada Post workers have been on strike since Nov. 15, shutting down the government-owned carrier's operations throughout the country.

The work stoppage comes after Canada Post failed to reach new contract agreements with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents more than 55,000 of the carrier's employees. The union is calling for pay raises, safer working conditions and an expansion of public postal services.

As negotiations continue, shippers with last-mile delivery needs in Canada are diverting volume to other carriers as they try to keep up with the peak holiday ordering rush. But this response is straining many delivery providers' networks during an already busy period.

Here's what parcel shippers should know about the Canada Post strike, including its impact on shipping times and capacity at other carriers.

How long will the Canada Post strike last?

The strike's duration depends on how soon Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers can resolve their differences and reach an agreement.

The parties have exchanged a series of counterproposals on their next labor deal since discussions reignited last week. Jan Simpson, national president of the union, said in a Dec. 4 update that its proposals feature movement on both union and employer demands.

""We all want CUPW members to get back on the job with their rights protected, health and safety issues resolved, wages that reflect inflation, and security for the future in new collective agreements,"" Simpson said.

On Saturday, Canada Post said it has ""made significant moves to close the gap on key issues like weekend delivery, pensions and wages and bring much-needed urgency to the discussions."" However, the Toronto Star reported the next day that the union expressed frustration over the carrier’s latest proposal.

""Based on the union's response, what they've put out to the public, they're still far from seeing eye to eye on these proposals,"" Alison Layfield, director of product development at ePost Global, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.

Whenever the strike ends, its impact will continue to linger. When Canada Post service resumes, delays are likely as the carrier delivers stored volume ""on a first-in, first-out basis,"" according to its website.

Maggie Barnett, CEO of LVK Logistics, a fulfillment provider in Canada and the U.S., expects it will take up to 10 days once the strike ends for Canada Post's operations to normalize.

""Everyone's going to come out of the gate sluggish, and there's going to be a lot to do, because there's things just sitting in the system,"" Barnett said.

How disruptive has the strike been for deliveries?

Delays are mounting throughout the Canada parcel industry due to the strike.

On-time delivery performance in Canada has dropped by 14% since the week of Oct. 28, according to a Dec. 3 report from project44. The company considers a package to be on time if it reaches its destination by the original estimated delivery date.

The steep drop is due in part to Canada Post's major presence in the country's parcel market and limited variety in shippers' carrier rosters, according to project44. While project44 shippers use around six last-mile carriers on average, that falls to less than three for inbound and outbound Canada shipments.

""Because of this lack of carrier diversity, when an event like the postal strike occurs, the Canadian market becomes highly vulnerable to disruptions,"" project44 said. ""Shippers are now scrambling to find capacity and must make tough decisions between cost and delivery time.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimated that the strike would cost small- and medium-sized companies more than $1 billion by Dec. 4, as they grapple with more expensive delivery alternatives and lost orders. One example the federation mentioned was a seed supplier in Prince Edward Island that can't deliver its catalogs during the work stoppage.

""Rather than looking forward to increased revenue, it’s now facing substantial storage fees for the large volume of printed materials and says orders for Christmas will be low,"" the group said.

Can other carriers pick up the slack?

With packages in the Canada Post network at a standstill, many shippers are scrambling to find alternative delivery options. But securing enough capacity with another carrier is a tall order during the holidays, Barnett said.

""That's creating further delays, because the folks who are taking that Canada Post volume are unable to absorb that volume during peak season,"" she said.

Carriers are deploying different strategies to manage the volume influx. This is evident in how UPS and Canada parcel carrier Purolator each handled shipments from eShipper, which connects e-commerce businesses with delivery providers.

UPS froze shipments from eShipper for 48 hours, while Purolator is looking to limit the number of packages it picks up from the company, Imtiaz Kermali, eShipper VP of sales and marketing, said during a Thursday webinar.

""We're going to get to the normality a lot faster if we help these carriers think through what their strategy is right now, which is, let's get rid of these clogs, add more capacity and try and come back even stronger over the next two weeks,"" Kermali said.

UPS did not respond to a request for comment. Purolator is temporarily pausing service to select shipping partners as it navigates ""a significant increase in volume,"" the company told Supply Chain Dive on Thursday.

""This was necessary to maintain the integrity of our network, ensure the health and safety of our employees and allow us to prioritize critical shipments,"" Purolator said in an email. ""We are assessing the condition of our network hourly and will make all attempts to remove the service suspension as soon as possible.""

Other carriers are also adjusting in the wake of the strike. On Nov. 29, the U.S. Postal Service suspended its acceptance of international mail to Canada. FedEx has instituted ""a temporary limit of five packages per drop-off"" at its retail locations to manage higher demand, a company spokesperson told CBC News on Friday.

How can shippers limit disruptions from the strike?

Securing access to carriers that suit your particular shipping needs goes a long way, experts say.

For example, shippers with packages moving from the U.S. into Canada should make sure they're using a ""door-to-door"" service that doesn't rely on Canada Post for any portion of the delivery process, Barnett said.

Companies also have to consider what areas of Canada they deliver to. While a handful of major carriers can cover around 80% to 90% of the country, that service typically comes with a residential delivery surcharge, Kermali said. Smaller, regional carriers tend not to have this added fee, but they also are limited in coverage outside major cities.

""They do not criss-cross across the country, connecting those regions unless they have an outside partner that could be an airline or a ground partner who will move product from, let's say, Toronto to Vancouver, and then they'll deliver in Vancouver,"" Kermali added.

Beyond carrier adjustments, companies should also consider how to keep customers happy during the strike, Jen Seran, former director of business operations at e-commerce shipping provider Stallion Express, wrote in a LinkedIn post. This includes providing clear and transparent communication about potential delays, leveraging physical store locations for pickups and offering discounted or free shipping.

""While the current disruptions pose challenges, they also offer a chance to get creative with your logistics,"" Seran said."

200,2024-12-06 00:00:00,Inside the ‘brutal’ logistical challenge of staging a Formula One Grand Prix,"Doha, Qatar CNN —

With Formula One cars rocketing around Lusail International Circuit at average speeds comfortably north of 130 miles per hour (210 kilometers per hour), the Qatar Grand Prix was all over in little more than 90 minutes.

Yet even while the checkered flag waves and fireworks light up the Doha skyline, hundreds of staff scuttle around the 10 respective team garages as they start a race of their own to transport the entire operation to Abu Dhabi in a matter of days for the next Grand Prix.

In a meticulously technical sport spanning 24 races, 21 countries and five continents across nine months of 2024, it is a unique and dizzying logistical challenge only further complicated by the sweeping fan, hospitality and entertainment extravaganza that follows in its wake.

“We call it the circus. It really is a traveling family,” F1 chief communications and corporate relations officer Liam Parker told CNN.

“We’re everywhere, and that’s what makes it special. It really is a global sporting spectacular … It’s not just racing anymore – it’s entertainment, it’s music, it’s celebrity.”

Even after a decade of reporting on the sport, PA Media’s F1 correspondent Phil Duncan still marvels at how teams cope.

“We’re talking about as many as 4,000 people (team staff) traveling to all the different races,” Duncan told CNN.

“How they manage to transport all the people around the world, all the hardware, the cars, the machinery, the parts – it’s quite a remarkable achievement.”

Pressure

So, to take the Qatar Grand Prix as a case study, just how do they do it?

It’s certainly not by getting plenty of sleep, insists Aston Martin race team coordinator Joe Micklewright, a former sous chef whose myriad responsibilities on race week began the second he arrived – bleary-eyed – in Doha on Monday following a 17-hour flight.

Lusail International Circuit marked the middle leg of a triple-header – three race weekends in a row – to close out the 2024 season, sandwiched between Las Vegas and the final Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi on December 8.

After snagging a few hours of sleep, Micklewright awoke Tuesday morning to meet the air freight carrying some 25 tons of essential cargo – including the two cars – that he had arranged to follow him some 8,000 miles from the US.

And that’s not to mention enough tables, chairs and other pieces of less critical garage equipment to fill five separate shipping containers that arrive via sea freight. Aston Martin alternates six sets of such containers globally in order to reach all 24 races in time, with the Doha shipment already en route to Australia for the 2025 curtain-raiser in March.

That all adds up to approximately 50 tons of freight transported to every Grand Prix by each team.

With such tight deadlines – including a strict curfew that restricts the amount of time staff can work on the cars on a Wednesday and Thursday of a race week (roughly 12 hours each day) – even the most minor of travel complications can be acutely damaging.

“We do have a lot of pressure,” said Micklewright, adding that a customs delay led to the air freight arriving almost four hours late to Doha.

“We’ve got to get the right equipment to the right place at the right time and our paperwork has got to be up to scratch. Otherwise, it all just creates delays and that just has a knock-on effect all the time.”

Assembly of the cars, each comprising some 5,000 components, begins Wednesday as the garage is assembled around it in order to be fully functional by Thursday.

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday – practice, qualifying and the Grand Prix respectively – Micklewright is part of the crew tasked with looking after driver Fernando Alonso’s tires, even getting involved in pit stops if required.

This role is simply one more paragraph on his extensive job description, with Micklewright’s other duties including maintenance of the garage, handling any ad hoc team issues with hotels or car hire, and liaising with some of the roughly 800 staff back at team headquarters in Silverstone, England.

As jet lag compounds the general fatigue of a globetrotting campaign that began in earnest with the unveiling of the 2024 car in February, leaning on the support of the “traveling family” is paramount.

“It does take a toll on you, especially at the end of the season. You do get quite tired,” Micklewright admitted.

“When things aren’t going well, you’ve got to stick together, put your arm around each other and make sure you just get through it. You’ve just got to keep going.”

‘There’s no better feeling’

It’s a sentiment echoed by Micklewright’s logistical counterpart at rival team Haas, trackside operations manager Neil Hanley.

With less than 300 total staff spread across England, Italy and the US, Haas are the smallest team on the grid, according to Hanley, who begins drawing up schematics for the garage six weeks before each race.

Such foreplanning is essential given the comparative lack of personnel, but what Haas – currently seventh in the Constructors’ Championship – lacks in numbers it makes up for in heart and camaraderie, Hanley insists.

“They are just a great bunch of people,” he told CNN.

“It starts even from the catering team, our logistics suppliers. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are. We wouldn’t get those points without the mechanics on the ground … without the engineering departments, without the management and the engineers and the drivers, if we didn’t work as a cohesive team.”

“Sunday night when that checkered flag goes down, if we’ve got one or two cars in the points – there’s no better feeling,” he added.

That flag drop signals the start of a mad dash to totally disassemble the garage and pack all the equipment onto their respective freights, an operation that extended well into early Monday morning in Doha.

Past the halfway mark of a “brutal” triple-header, it is only when Hanley boards a plane bound for Abu Dhabi a couple of hours later – blissfully uncontactable – that he can catch his breath.

That’s until landing, when the circus reopens again.

“It doesn’t stop,” Hanley said. “We can’t just say its the hours at one race – it’s hundreds, thousands of hours just to get these cars on the ground. Twelve hours a day, seven days a week at one event.

“Those sat (watching) on the sofas, who haven’t got family members or loved ones within a team, probably wouldn’t see or know the amount of time we spend on the road.”"
201,2024-12-05 00:00:00,District of Columbia says Amazon secretly stopped fast deliveries to 2 predominantly Black ZIP codes,"AP —

The District of Columbia sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging the company secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods while still charging millions of dollars for a membership that promises the benefit.

The complaint filed in District of Columbia Superior Court revolves around Amazon’s Prime membership, which costs consumers $139 per year or $14.99 per month for fast deliveries — including one-day, two-day and same-day shipments — along with other enhancements.

In mid-2022, the lawsuit alleges, the Seattle-based online retailer imposed what it called a delivery “exclusion” on two low-income ZIP codes in the district — 20019 and 20020 — and began relying exclusively on third-party delivery services such as UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, rather than its own delivery systems.

Amazon says it made the change based on concerns about driver safety.

“There have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages” in the two ZIP codes and the company made the change to “put the safety of delivery drivers first,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement.

“We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers,” Nantel said. “The claims made by the attorney general, that our business practices are somehow discriminatory or deceptive, are categorically false.”

The District of Columbia’s attorney general’s office alleged the company never told Prime members in the two ZIP codes about the change even though they experienced slower deliveries as a result. Amazon also did not tell new customers about the exclusions when they signed up for Prime memberships, the lawsuit says.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement, referencing the two areas in the city where Amazon is accused of excluding its speediest deliveries.

“While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,” Schwalb said.

The lawsuit says Amazon has nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the two ZIP codes, a number that represents nearly half of the population. Prime members in those neighborhoods have ordered more than 4.5 million packages in the past four years, and are more likely to rely on Amazon since they have fewer services and retail stores nearby, the city said. The area is also a notorious food desert.

The district says that in 2021, before Amazon implemented its delivery “exclusion,” more than 72% of Prime packages in the impacted ZIP codes were delivered within two days. But last year, it was only 24%, according to the complaint.

Meanwhile, the district’s lawsuit says Prime members who lived in other parts of the city received two-day deliveries 75% of the time. Amazon was also improving its delivery speeds nationwide.

When some customers in the city complained about the slower deliveries, Amazon concealed the true reason for the delays and “deceptively implied” that the delays “were simply due to natural fluctuations in shipping circumstances, rather than an affirmative decision by Amazon,” the lawsuit says.

District officials are asking the court to issue an order prohibiting Amazon from “engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.” They also want the company to pay restitution or damages to affected Prime members, as well as civil penalties.

This isn’t the first time Amazon has been accused of offering slower deliveries to some places where Black people make up most of the households.

In 2016, American news outlet Bloomberg published an investigation that said Black residents of cities like Atlanta and Chicago were about half as likely as white residents to live in neighborhoods with access to Amazon’s same-day delivery service.

Local news website DCist reported a year later that Amazon’s restaurant delivery service — which the company shut down five years ago — had excluded some neighborhoods in Washington, including one of the ZIP codes mentioned in the district’s lawsuit.

Nantel said Amazon is “always transparent” with its customers “during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive.”

Since 2022, nearly 1.5 million Prime-eligible products were delivered in two days or less to Prime customers residing in the two ZIP codes, the company said.

“What we’d like to do, and have offered, is to work together with the attorney general and their office in an effort to reduce crime and improve safety in these areas,” Nantel aid. “Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the safety of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.”

The complaint filed Wednesday represents the second major legal battle between Amazon and the District of Columbia which also filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company."
202,NaN,The world’s hunger watchdog warned of catastrophe in Sudan. Famine struck anyway.,"Prior to the war, the WFP stored aid at warehouses across Sudan in anticipation of the lean season between harvests. After hostilities broke out, widespread looting slashed its stockpiles.

In May 2023, anticipating warfare in al-Fashir, the WFP took a pre-emptive step. It delivered all the food from its warehouses there – two months’ worth of assistance – to more than 180,000 people in North Darfur. Some went to Zamzam.

It would be almost a year before WFP delivered more aid to the camp.

As the government continued to resist U.N. aid shipments via Chad, the WFP procured 31 metric tons of nutritional supplements in February and asked MSF to distribute them in Zamzam and two nearby camps. But it wasn’t until April that MSF was able to deliver the aid because of logistical hurdles, the WFP said.

More aid made it to Zamzam in subsequent weeks, but transport has proven difficult since then. In August, a convoy of aid trucks set out for North Darfur and got stuck on muddy roads amid the rainy season. The convoy never arrived.

The WFP said it still was able to feed 100,000 people in Zamzam in September and October with food it sourced locally. On Nov. 22, the WFP announced a convoy reached Zamzam with aid for 12,500 people.

That aid enabled MSF to resume treating children for malnutrition, said Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF’s head of emergency operations. But the sporadic supplies are not enough, he said. And the latest shelling has thrown medical care into disarray. Some MSF staff evacuated earlier this week.

Al-Bushra, the agriculture minister, said the government has designated eight aid routes for the transport of goods into and across the country. It also has authorized the use of several border crossings and airports for aid shipments and agreed to keep the Adre crossing open until February.

Similar promises the government made in March resulted in little improvement, however, and the WFP said this week that fighting is disrupting aid delivery.

The IPC’s finding of famine in Zamzam in August came late, said Eric Reeves, who heads Team Zamzam, a charity providing aid at the camp. And given the difficulty of consistently getting aid in, the IPC warning “has made absolutely no difference to the lives of the people of Zamzam.”

A scholar who has studied Sudan for 26 years, Reeves said the Sudan hunger crisis is greater than any the world has seen in decades.

“The dying from starvation will not stop until there is full humanitarian access, and even then it will be difficult to forestall the deaths of many hundreds of thousands,” he said. “Once underway, true famine is extremely difficult to bring to an end.”"

Too many tech founders try to solve problems they don’t understand. I can’t blame them—the tech world is swarming with sayings like ""move fast and break things"" and ""fail fast, learn faster."" As a founder myself, I understand the importance of conviction and acting swiftly on hypotheses.

However, I also understand the value of solutions based on real-life experience. Theoretical solutions can provide benefits, but they often don’t move the needle. Even the best idea is just an idea until it’s paired with practical experience.

You can learn an incredible amount by listening to those on the ground about the issues they face. An even better way to learn? Experiencing those issues yourself, first hand.

That’s the first thing I did when starting my company, and we've continued as the company has scaled. Every teammate in every department is encouraged to set aside time in their schedule to deliver packages throughout the cities we serve using our app.

The lessons we’ve learned through this immersion fundamentally inform our product roadmap, how we interact with driver-partners on our platform and how we solve real-life customer problems.

The Power Of Putting Boots On The Ground

I find that industry incumbents—the so-called ""sleeping giants""—can be some of the worst offenders when it comes to distance from the problems they say they are aiming to solve. They often don’t understand the pain points the customer is facing; their processes are deeply ingrained and often outdated; and they've spent decades preserving their existing systems (and profits) instead of adapting to a changing world with changing customer needs.

In the worst cases, companies are so out of touch that even if they innovate, they create products that don’t effectively serve their customer base.

Issues In Shipping

As Steve Jobs used to say, ""You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work your way back to the technology."" That’s how I decided to tackle the issues plaguing last-mile delivery. Returning to my apartment one evening, I was taken aback by the many ""Sorry We Missed You"" delivery slips stuck to the building front door.

There was an undeniable customer experience issue with shipping, one that needed to be addressed. Like anyone who shops online (and considering one in five purchases now happens via e-commerce, that’s most of us), I’ve dealt with everything from impractical delivery windows, lack of communication and customization to having my packages left in bizarre places and not receiving them at all.

But I didn’t know what caused these issues on the drivers’ side. To build something that wouldn’t just sound good on paper but would actually improve last-mile delivery, I needed to understand all angles of the problem.

Firsthand Experience

So, I signed up to be a delivery driver and started driving routes and delivering packages throughout Boston. I quickly came to understand the disconnect between consumers’ desire for up-to-date, accurate information about delivery windows and the day-to-day challenges drivers face. I contended with outdated technology, inaccurate navigation tools, unpredictable traffic and weather and the difficulty of planning the most streamlined route.

I often arrived at an address only to realize it was impossible to access the building and make a secure delivery because of a locked gate or a missing access code. I wanted to contact consumers directly to alert them to delays and ask for clarifying instructions, but I had no way to do so. I had no idea how many barriers there were to this basic positive customer experience.

Designing A Better System

Solving a problem must start with understanding the root cause of the problem. And understanding the problem requires that we build empathy toward those who experience it.

While some founders already have lived experience with the problem they’re seeking to address, others—like me—need to go out and get that experience. This can be key in designing a new model that comprehensively solves problems and turns your insights into a true value driver for customers.

I already knew how frustrating it was to have my packages delayed or damaged—but delivering packages myself helped me empathize with both those expecting packages and those delivering them. I realized those receiving packages needed the ability to give drivers not just their address but specific instructions (what access code to use, which staircase to take and so on).

Collaboration And Knowledge-Sharing

Once I had this firsthand experience, I had to document and scale my insights. This brought me face to face with one of the biggest challenges faced by many companies: Knowledge and information silos.

Businesses seeking to streamline their processes often find that a breakdown of knowledge-sharing between departments, or even between teams and people within the same department, can cause inefficiency and errors. One team may invent the perfect solution for an issue, but if they can’t share it with the rest of the company, the next person to encounter that issue will be back to square one.

When it came to my company, firsthand experience helped me understand that dismantling silos meant giving drivers the ability to ask customers questions en route and share information and advice with one another. By centralizing this information, we could ensure that the delivery process kept improving.

Learning From The Past And Adapting

By combining real-life knowledge with an innovative mindset, we can be smart about the solutions we pursue. Knowing exactly which issues affect our clients makes it possible to immediately see how we might leverage the latest tech.

For example, we’re experimenting with improving future deliveries by learning from past ones through machine learning, especially in complicated environments like apartment complexes, gated communities and office parks.

By experiencing the process you're trying to improve firsthand, you can move fast and solve real problems.

204,2024-12-03 00:00:00,FBI Warns—These Holiday Shopping Scams Could Ruin Your 2024 Season,"FBI agent working on his computer in office getty

The holiday season is a time of joy and celebration, but it’s also prime hunting season for scammers. In 2024, the FBI has issued a warning to consumers about the growing risks of holiday-related fraud. With cybercriminals using increasingly sophisticated tactics and online shopping continuing to grow, more opportunities exist for fraudsters to exploit unsuspecting consumers than ever before.

Holiday Scams: Why 2024 Is A Particularly Risky Year

The FBI’s warning comes against a backdrop of record-setting online shopping activity. With holiday e-commerce sales projected to exceed $260 billion this year, scammers have more opportunities than ever to target victims. Fraudsters are deploying advanced techniques such as AI-generated fake websites and realistic phishing emails to trick even the most careful consumers.

Younger shoppers are particularly at risk. According to the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, individuals aged 18 to 39 are 25% more likely to fall victim to online shopping scams than older adults. These shoppers, who rely heavily on e-commerce platforms and social media ads, often encounter scams disguised as unbelievable holiday deals.

The Real-World Impact Of Holiday Scams

The financial stakes of holiday scams are staggering. In 2023, U.S. consumers lost $10 billion to various scams, marking a $1 billion increase from the previous year. Among these, non-delivery scams accounted for $73 million in losses, as consumers paid for goods that never arrived. Gift card fraud, another common tactic, drained $148 million from victims, leaving them with no recourse to recover their money.

The emotional toll is just as significant. Victims often report feelings of stress, anxiety, and betrayal, especially during the holidays when finances and trust are paramount. Falling for a scam can disrupt the festive spirit and cause long-lasting financial hardships.

Common Holiday Scams And How They Work

Here are some of the most common cyber holiday scams to watch out for:

Non-Delivery Scams

Among the most common holiday scams is the non-delivery scam, where fraudsters set up fake e-commerce websites or post counterfeit listings on legitimate platforms like eBay or Facebook Marketplace. These scams often target high-demand items such as gaming consoles, smartphones, or designer goods.

A shopper scrolling through their favorite marketplace spots a deal too good to pass up—a brand-new gaming console priced far below retail. Excited to snag a bargain, they quickly click ""Buy Now,"" enter their payment information, and anticipate the shipping confirmation. But days pass, then weeks, with no sign of the item. Emails to the seller go unanswered, and the listing mysteriously disappears from the site. It’s only after countless failed attempts to track down the seller that the realization sets in—the deal was a scam, and the money is gone for good.

Gift Card Fraud Scams

Scammers frequently target victims through gift card fraud, exploiting the season’s popularity for prepaid cards as gifts. In this scheme, fraudsters impersonate charities, retailers, or even trusted acquaintances, asking victims to purchase gift cards and share the card numbers and PINs.

A scammer might pose as a charitable organization soliciting donations for holiday meals or gifts for children. Alternatively, a fraudster could impersonate a retailer, claiming that a gift card is the only accepted form of payment for a time-sensitive deal.

Fake Charity Scams

The holiday season inspires generosity, but it also provides fertile ground for fake charity scams. Fraudsters create fictitious organizations, often using names, logos, or slogans that closely resemble those of reputable charities. They may reach out via phone calls, social media posts, or emails urging donors to act quickly to ""make a difference"" during the holidays.

Tactics often include emotional appeals, such as helping families in need or providing toys for children, and pushing for immediate donations, often via untraceable payment methods like wire transfers or gift cards. A survey by AARP found that 80% of U.S. consumers encountered at least one holiday-related scam in 2023, with fake charity requests being a frequent tactic.

Phishing Emails and Fake Websites

Phishing emails and fake websites are among the most sophisticated scams today, designed to deceive even experienced online shoppers. Fraudsters craft communications that appear to come from legitimate retailers, delivery services or payment platforms. They become especially dangerous during the holiday season because they exploit the unique pressures and behaviors of this time of year. The holidays are a whirlwind of online activity—shoppers are racing to find deals, track orders and manage last-minute purchases. Scammers know this, and they tailor their schemes to blend seamlessly into the frenzy.

Imagine receiving an email claiming there’s a problem with your recent order— a package delay or a payment issue. During the holidays, with orders from multiple retailers in transit, it’s easy to lose track. The email looks legitimate, complete with a recognizable logo and professional formatting. Feeling the urgency to resolve the issue and avoid delivery delays, the recipient clicks the link without hesitation. They’re taken to a convincing website where they’re prompted to enter login credentials or payment details. By the time they realize the site is fake, their sensitive information is in the hands of scammers.

What makes these scams even more potent during the holidays is the sheer volume of legitimate emails consumers receive, from shipping updates and promotional offers to invoices and account notifications. This overload makes it harder to differentiate between real and fraudulent communications. Advanced techniques, like AI-generated fake websites and phishing emails that mimic corporate branding, only add to the challenge.

TransUnion’s data underscores the scale of the threat. During the 2023 holiday season, 3.6% of global e-commerce transactions were flagged as potentially fraudulent, and that number is expected to climb in 2024. With so much at stake, staying vigilant against these ""digital wolves in sheep’s clothing"" is more important than ever during the holiday rush.

What The FBI Recommends

The FBI’s advice to consumers is straightforward: vigilance is your best defense against holiday scams. Here is what the FBI recommends:

Verify Website URL Addresses

Shoppers are urged to verify website URLs, ensuring it begins with ""https"" and includes a padlock icon in the address bar.

When the FBI advises shoppers to check for ""https"" in website URLs and look for a padlock icon, they’re addressing a fundamental scam tactic: fake websites. These fraudulent sites are designed to look nearly identical to legitimate retailers, often with minor differences in the URL—like a misspelled brand name or an added character. The ""https"" and padlock symbol indicate a secure connection, which helps ensure that any data you enter, like payment information, is encrypted and harder for scammers to intercept. By independently typing the retailer’s URL into your browser instead of clicking links in emails or ads, you avoid the risk of being redirected to a convincing but fraudulent site.

Be Wary Of “Too Good To Be True” Deals

The FBI’s warning about unrealistic discounts highlights how scammers play on the holiday rush and desire for bargains. Massive markdowns on high-demand items like gaming consoles or electronics can create a sense of urgency—“Act now before the deal ends!” This pressure often leads shoppers to skip basic precautions, like verifying the legitimacy of the seller. Scammers thrive on this impulsive behavior, collecting payments for goods that don’t exist. The advice to slow down and critically evaluate deals helps counteract the emotional manipulation scammers rely on.

Use Secure Payment Methods

The FBI’s emphasis on using credit cards rather than gift cards or wire transfers reflects the protections built into credit card transactions. Credit cards allow consumers to dispute unauthorized charges and often provide fraud monitoring services. Conversely, payments made through gift cards or wire transfers are nearly impossible to recover once sent, which is why scammers frequently demand these methods. This advice ensures that, if something goes wrong, consumers have a safety net to recover their funds.

Verify Charities Before Donating

Holiday generosity makes charitable giving a prime target for scammers. The FBI’s recommendation to check charities through tools like Charity Navigator or the Better Business Bureau addresses the prevalence of fake charity scams. Fraudsters exploit the goodwill of the season by creating organizations that mimic legitimate ones, often with names or logos that look authentic. By verifying the legitimacy of the charity, donors can ensure their contributions go to the intended cause rather than into the pockets of scammers. This advice also helps combat emotional manipulation, as fraudulent charities often use urgent, heart-wrenching appeals to elicit impulsive donations.

Monitor The Shipping Process

The FBI advises holiday shoppers to carefully monitor the shipping process for their online purchases to avoid falling victim to scams or package theft.

The holidays bring a surge in e-commerce activity, which scammers exploit through non-delivery scams and fake tracking information. By requesting and using tracking numbers, buyers can:

Confirm Shipment : A valid tracking number from the seller serves as proof that your order has been shipped. If a seller fails to provide one, it’s a potential red flag.

: A valid tracking number from the seller serves as proof that your order has been shipped. If a seller fails to provide one, it’s a potential red flag. Detect Fraud Early: If a tracking number seems invalid or unverifiable, it’s often a sign that something is wrong. Acting quickly can help you dispute charges and report scams before it’s too late.

The FBI warns that sellers also need to safeguard their transactions, especially during the holidays when scams targeting sellers increase. Be cautious with purchases where the shipping address differs from the billing address on the credit card. These mismatches often indicate fraudulent activity, such as the use of stolen credit cards. Good practices for sellers include:

Require Cardholder Authorization : Always verify the buyer’s identity and get explicit authorization from the cardholder before shipping items to an alternate address.

: Always verify the buyer’s identity and get explicit authorization from the cardholder before shipping items to an alternate address. Use Secure Payment Systems : Payment systems should flag mismatched addresses for further review, helping sellers detect potential fraud early.

: Payment systems should flag mismatched addresses for further review, helping sellers detect potential fraud early. Retain Proof of Shipment: Always keep tracking information and proof of delivery. This documentation is vital if a buyer disputes the transaction or claims the item was not received.

What To Do If You’ve Been Caught In A Holiday Scam

If you suspect you’ve fallen victim to a scam, the FBI urges immediate action. Start by filing a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, or IC3. Next, contact your bank or credit card provider to dispute fraudulent charges and secure your accounts. If sensitive personal information was stolen, consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze on your credit file to prevent further misuse.

The FTC also offers resources for reporting scams and recovering from identity theft. Reporting fraudulent activity not only helps authorities track down scammers but also prevents others from becoming victims.

The FBI’s 2024 holiday scam warning is a reminder that protecting yourself requires more than luck. It requires awareness and caution. The combination of increased online shopping, sophisticated scam tactics, and consumer distractions creates a perfect storm for fraud. By staying informed, verifying suspicious offers, and using secure payment methods, you can ensure a safer shopping experience this season."
205,2024-12-03 11:17:00,What shippers and carriers seek from a modern TMS,"When Mattress Next Day CEO Martin Seeley first considered adopting a transportation management system, he wasn't sure the technology was the right fit for the online mattress retailer.

But once Mattress Next Day implemented Transporeon’s TMS, Seeley realized it was a game changer “for next-day delivery businesses like mine.” The TMS’ critical features include real-time visibility, route planning and scheduling.

Supply chains have become more global and intermodal, and consumers want fast shipping and real-time visibility. Shippers and carriers need a TMS that integrates with other systems and uses emerging technology to keep up with modern demands.

Numerous feature-rich TMS platforms are on the market, but there's always room for improvement, especially as logistics challenges evolve.

“TMS’s are great. They do a lot of things really well,” said Brock Johns, director analyst in the logistics and technology team at Gartner. “But they don't necessarily solve all problems.”

A connected, integrated TMS

Above all, shippers and carriers’ want their TMS’s to integrate smoothly with other technology systems. For shippers, that primarily means connecting to warehouse and yard management systems to avoid keeping data siloed in separate applications.

Integrating technology platforms is especially important today, when businesses often have several sourcing locations and myriad modes of transport, Johns said.

“I hesitate to say we'll eventually get to ‘the everything TMS,’” Johns said. “But I think we are slowly, incrementally inching [in] that direction.”

Lining up transportation and inventory with an integrated TMS helps shippers — and by extension, consumers — trace freight throughout the supply chain.

Ray Lauzums, the owner of online toys, games and collectibles retailer Poggers, said his Tailwind TMS is “super useful for connecting everything we do,” including invoicing, recording driver logs and managing transportation data. In the future, he’d like to see the TMS integrate with internet-connected devices and blockchain.

“I hesitate to say we'll eventually get to ‘the everything TMS.’ But I think we are slowly, incrementally inching [in] that direction.” Brock Johns Director analyst in the logistics and technology team at Gartner

Brett Phillips, president and CEO of The 1975 Transportation Group, uses McLeod’s TMS and was able to integrate the system with telematics and electronic data interchange. Phillips said a TMS is a must-have in today’s operating environment, as fleets have endured a long freight recession and high costs, making it critical to stay lean.

“Automation within your TMS helps your team do more with fewer people,” Phillips said.

Carriers often work with multiple brokers on several different load boards, which aren’t tied directly into the carrier TMS. That can lead to “app fatigue,” said Sean Gill, VP of business solutions at Arrive Logistics, as carriers are asked to download dozens of different apps.

Arrive Logistics has built a proprietary TMS with web portals for carriers and shippers. Businesses also have access to Arrive's load data through an API integration, enabling them to view load information directly in their own TMS.

As tech evolves, so should TMS platforms

A lot of existing technology hasn't been optimized for TMS platforms yet. For example, some TMS’s are still web- or desktop-based and are not compatible for mobile devices, Gill said.

That was one reason Seeley picked Transporeon. He said its mobile access “runs very smoothly,” compared to others such as SAP, which has “poorly built” mobile access apps.

Email integration is another shortcoming for some TMS platforms. “As much data as we store in a TMS, there is probably five times as much data in email inboxes,” Gill said. This disconnect leads to manual data transfer, or information that never makes it into the TMS.

TMS vendors have started to address the disconnect between email and TMS platforms. Arrive Logistics’ software scans carrier inboxes and classifies email, entering the information into the TMS.

Other technologies, such as predictive analytics and artificial intelligence, are newer to the market, and carriers and shippers are eager to see those capabilities come to TMS platforms.

“As much data as we store in a TMS, there is probably five times as much data in email inboxes."" Sean Gill VP of business solutions at Arrive Logistics

Lauzums said he wants machine learning in a TMS that can more quickly predict delivery times and spot problematic shipments to avoid delays, an issue his company faced during a recent snowstorm.

“Tailwind flagged the delay accurately. But they didn't give any ideas on how it might affect other routes or potential fixes,” Lauzums said. “If Tailwind's machine learning could predict delays better, we could have talked to customers sooner about options to keep things on schedule.”

Phillips said he’d like to see more TMS-generated fleet summaries and dashboards to help automate KPI monitoring.

Beyond that, AI and large language models are starting to change how users interact with TMS platforms. Think of it as “chatbots on steroids,” Johns said. Instead of inputting bill of lading numbers, a user can ask the status of a shipment going from A to B and receive the answer in real time. If a customer calls to ask for a status update, this could save time, as the language model can finds answers rather than a person manually searching by order number.

Generative AI also has the potential to make TMS interfaces more user-friendly. If a company’s resident TMS expert leaves the firm, “there's a dearth of that knowledge,” Johns said. But Gen AI can allow interaction with the TMS in a way that’s intuitive, such as allowing users to ask how to do a task or where to find a specific data point.

Johns said TMS vendors are starting to explore how this capability can fit into the TMS.

“It's a way to extend the knowledge to much broader groups of people and empower more people that can use that TMS,” he noted."
206,NaN,Canada Post strike strains Christmas shopping season,"Why Canada’s Christmas presents may not be delivered on time this year

Getty Images

It’s one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year, but for many Canadians, this year’s Black Friday deals may not arrive before Christmas – and that could be a death knell for already hard-hit small businesses. Two weeks into a national postal service strike at Canada Post, and many businesses say they’ve suffered steep financial losses as customers have had to wait for their orders. Inventory sits in warehouses across the country and shipping costs have increased. Lorne James, who owns Otter Valley Railway, a model train company in Tillsonburg, Ontario, estimates he’s lost C$120,000 ($85,600; £67,200) in sales since the strike began. “It's going to wipe out a good number of businesses,” he told the BBC. He estimated that about 80% of his orders are received online, and up until two weeks ago, 99% of his deliveries were done with Canada Post. Negotiations between the company and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPOW) have broken down, amid massive financial losses, especially over the issue of allowing temporary workers to help expand the company's delivery to seven-days-a-week.

Otter Valley Railway Lorne James says one thing Canadians can do to help out small businesses during the strike: buy in store

Bruce Winder, a Canadian retail analyst, said that while the growth of online shopping has led to new courier companies entering the market, Canada Post is often the most affordable, and has the network to deliver in rural areas many other companies won’t. The strike could not come at a worse time, Mr Winder said. For companies that sell things that can be gifted, Christmas sales can account for 30-40% of their annual revenue, he told the BBC. He also predicts that this year, Canadians were already planning on spending less, because of the rise in the cost-of-living. “It's a double whammy, you know, because they've got the Canada Post strike and they've got sort of negative consumer sentiment,” he said. Mr James said he’s doing better than most, because he negotiated contracts with other delivery services prior to the strike – but shipping overseas with a different carrier was too expensive, which has him losing out on some orders this holiday season. In an open letter, Canadian company Shopify, which helps businesses set up online stores, urged the government to intervene to “prevent a devastating blow to Canadian small businesses at their most critical time of year”. The letter came after the federally appointed mediator suspended talks on Wednesday. “His assessment is that parties remain too far apart on critical issues for mediation to be successful at this time,” said Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon on X. The union says it is bargaining for inflationary pay rises, better benefits, and for the company to agree to not hire outside-contractors. Meanwhile, Canada Post says it needs to have more flexible work hours – and hire more temporary workers - in order to move to seven-day delivery and be more competitive.

The union told the BBC the current standstill ""didn’t need to be this way"". ""[We] only took the difficult decision to call a strike after Canada Post announced the end to the existing collective agreements, an end to health benefits and to lay-offs,"" the union said in a statement. The statement said that postal workers are ""deeply aware"" of the hurt the strike is causing communities, pointing to its decision to delay contract negotiations so workers could deliver throughout the pandemic. It said the company is trying to replace full-time unionised jobs with temporary ""gig"" workers. In a statement to the BBC, the company said it understands the impact this strike is having on Canadians, but that they could not afford to not make transformative changes. ""With mounting financial losses in the billions, Canada Post requires greater flexibility to its outdated, mail-based delivery model. This is about the future of the postal service and growing revenues by better serving Canadians."" The union, meanwhile, said it believes the company can be profitable without gig work, and pointed to its proposal to adopt the UK model of having the post office offer low-fee mail banking. At issue, says Carleton University public policy professor Ian Lee, who has spent several decades researching the country’s postal service, is the very survival of Canada Post itself. “It’s Armageddon,” he told the BBC, comparing the fate of Canada Post to that of Blockbuster Video. Canada Post, which is a for-profit company owned by the federal government, posted a C$749m loss during the 2023 fiscal year. The company’s biggest business used to be delivering letters - but letter volume has dropped from 5.5 billion pieces in 2006 to 2.3 billion in 2022 with the rise of the internet, according to the company’s annual report. Although parcel delivery has greatly increased with the advent of online shopping, they face stiff competition in the field, especially from Amazon, which uses its own couriers for many of its orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has faced similar issues, reporting a $9.5bn net loss during the last fiscal year. On Friday, the USPS announced it was pausing accepting mail destined for Canada due to Canada Post ""indicating that they are unable to process or deliver international mail or services as a result of the ongoing national strike"". But as the strike has dragged on, Canada Post’s financials have deteriorated even further. The company says it has delivered 10 million fewer parcels since the strike began. It began temporarily laying off striking workers this week, a move the union has called illegal. Canada Post has said the lay-offs are in accordance with the Canada Labour Code.

207,2024-11-29 00:00:00,'Crazy growth': How one product created a multi-million dollar brand,"'Crazy growth': How one product created a multi-million dollar brand

Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.

At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing – it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.

The company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress – now with over 50 designs – to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.

""Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 – right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,"" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. ""I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.

EXECUTIVE LOUNGE The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here.

""Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.""

Since then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (£118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.

The company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.

""We've had the biggest year in company history,"" Diamond said. ""The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.""

When we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying

Diamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.

""I was always drawn to retail,"" she says. ""I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure – loving fashion – turned out to be a viable career opportunity.""

Now, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.

I wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing – great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

There were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and … start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.

By 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.

Why do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?

It's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day – it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.

When we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: ""Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it."" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.

What are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?

There were – and continues to be – challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.

In 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.

But when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base – we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.

How do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?

We have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.

You've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?

I can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.

By the numbers 1 million nap dresses sold 50 styles of the Nap Dress 5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas 80 employees ~$150m valuation

How have you been expanding the brand?

We have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.

The home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim – and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.

The fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?

We focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.

I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way

What advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?

One of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: ""We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?"" That was never productive for me.

I had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.

Where do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?

My perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.

I'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].

209,2024-11-27 00:00:00,Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025,"Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter.

As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined.

The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia.

Nvidia Posts Largest Data Center Beat Since Hopper’s 2023 Breakout

Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion.

This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. I/O Fund

Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s.

Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations.

Nvidia’s Blackwell to Drive a Minimum of 50% Data Center Growth Next Year

What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper.

Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%.

Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone.

Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote:

‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year.

The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.”

Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue.

Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.”

Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year.

By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.”

Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters.

Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year.

Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025.

Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup:

Alphabet has reportedly ordered 400,000 GB200s worth $10 billion.

Microsoft has reportedly ordered 60,000 GB200s worth $2 billion.

Meta has reportedly ordered 360,000 GB200s worth $8 billion.

This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025.

Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025.

The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue.

Nvidia Faces Tough Comps Off Peak Growth

Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock.

Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast.

Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least.

A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. I/O Fund

For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026.

Margins Issues are Overblown

Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.”

Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace.

GAAP gross margin was 74.6% in Q3, just ahead of guidance for 74.4%. Adjusted gross margin was 75%, in line with guidance. This reiterated my view from last quarter that Q1 was the peak for gross margins, as margins have contracted about 380 bp since then.

For Q4, management guided for GAAP gross margin of 73%, +/- 0.5%, and adjusted gross margin of 73.5%, +/- 0.5%, for a sequential contraction of ~150-160 bp.

GAAP operating margin was 62.3% in Q3, increasing slightly from 62.1% in the prior quarter but up from 53.1% in the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin of 66.3% dipped slightly from 66.4% in Q2, but increased from 64.8% in the year ago quarter.

For Q4, similar to gross margins, management guided for sequential contraction based on operating expense forecasts. GAAP operating margin is implied to be 60.2%, while adjusted operating margin is implied to be 64.4%, or about a 200 bp sequential contraction.

Conclusion

The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report.

The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia.

Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout.

The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche, with 9 buys and real-time alerts from 2021 to 2022 below $20.

Even before special counsel Jack Smith formally asked that his criminal cases — the 2020 election subversion prosecution and the charges of mishandling classified documents — against Donald Trump be dismissed, it was already guaranteed the president-elect would never see a jury.

Here’s what you need to know about Smith’s move to seek the cases’ dismissal and how his prosecutions got to this point:

Trump’s election and retribution promises made this day inevitable: Trump’s reelection this month ensured that his federal criminal cases would face an early end. The former president vowed during his campaign to fire Smith if voters sent him back to the White House – a move at odds with how other presidents have handled special counsels. In the end, though, Trump didn’t need to sack Smith. He was already benefiting from a legal strategy of delay that made sure no trials got underway before election, which ultimately forced Smith’s hand.

The Supreme Court played a major role: If part of what happened was that Smith simply ran out of time to pursue the case against Trump, then the six-justice conservative majority on the Supreme Court had a key role to play in slowing things down. The high court granted Trump sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions in a highly anticipated 6-3 decision that was handed down in July, limiting the special counsel’s ability to move forward.

Judge Cannon killed the classified documents case: Trump hit the jackpot when the case was assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, an appointee of his with little trial experience. She threw a number of wrenches into the prosecutors’ case before dismissing it entirely this summer on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. Her handling of the charges was widely panned by legal experts.

Smith keeps door open for charges to be brought again: Smith said he was dropping the charges against the president-elect “without prejudice,” which in theory would keep open the door for charges to be brought again in the future.

The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago.

To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago.

The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined.

Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated:

“As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.”

Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut.

$5B+ in Blackwell Revenue for Q4

The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion.

The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each.

Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025.

Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position.

By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation.

Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.”

Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies.

Big Tech Capex to Surpass a Quarter Trillion

All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers.

Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well.

To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight.

In the first half of 2023, Big Tech spent ~$74 billion on capex. Through Q3, that sum had moved up to ~$109 billion.

In the first half of 2024, Big Tech spent nearly $104 billion, a 47% YoY increase. Through Q3, that sum had surged to $170 billion, up 56% YoY.

Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year.

Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! I/O Fund

For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026.

Nvidia Has Over 2X Better Margins Compared to Most Mag 7 Stocks

As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power.

The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively.

While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components.

While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year.

Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period.

Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! YCharts

Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year.

The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67.

In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions.

Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand.

Q3 Earnings Details:

Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2.

I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood.

Nvidia’s Q3 FY2025 Revenue:

Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters.

As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge.

For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations).

This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4.

It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again.

EPS:

This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%.

On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026:

Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR

Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR

Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR

Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR

Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR

Supply Constraints:

This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints.

The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month.

TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity.

By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023.

Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1.

Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.”

Nvidia’s China Exposure is Low

Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs.

Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024.

Semiconductor Peers are Quite Weak

Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500.

Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia.

Conclusion:

My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago.

Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report:

“Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.”

The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year.

Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power.

Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate.

The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars.

212,2024-11-20 00:00:00,What Business Leaders Need To Know To Have A Successful Holiday Season,"By: Greg Hewitt, CEO of DHL Express U.S.

getty

As we approach the 2024 holiday season, businesses—particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—must prepare for a time of both heightened opportunity and potential challenges. The National Retail Federation expects consumers to spend 2.5% to 3.5% more this holiday season than they did last year.

To succeed during this critical period, companies need to be aware of key trends, anticipate shifts in consumer behavior and equip themselves to handle increased demand. By focusing on flexibility, operational readiness and customer satisfaction, businesses could find great success while mitigating risks. Here’s what businesses need to know to ensure a successful holiday season.

Prepare for increased demand and flexibility in operations.

The holiday season, especially during events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, brings a significant surge in e-commerce activity. In fact, based on my company's internal data, we forecast a volume increase of over 40% compared to regular operating days, with peak days like December 23 expected to see a 50% rise in shipments.

To handle this surge, businesses need to ensure their supply chains can flexibly scale up operations. Whether it’s managing inventory, scheduling extra delivery fleets or hiring additional staff, operational flexibility will be key to meeting customer expectations.

Monitor global supply chain challenges.

Supply chain disruptions can create headaches during peak season, and businesses must stay ahead of potential issues. From unpredictable weather patterns to last-minute changes in consumer behavior, external factors can lead to capacity constraints and delays.

Businesses should closely monitor their supply chains and work with logistics providers who can offer agile solutions, such as additional shipping capacity or alternative transportation routes. Leaders should engage in regular dialogue with logistics partners to understand emerging risks and align on contingency plans. Emphasizing real-time data sharing can also improve responsiveness and make adjustments easier as conditions evolve.

To be able to adapt quickly to unexpected changes while maintaining high levels of service quality, businesses should also cultivate a network of reliable providers and consider diverse transportation options.

Focus on customer experience and communication.

Today’s consumers have high expectations, particularly during the holiday season when timely delivery and seamless experiences are essential. A recent survey from Radial reveals that 29% of consumers now anticipate receiving holiday orders within two to three days.

Businesses must prioritize clear communication, especially around shipping deadlines, delivery delays or potential stock shortages. Providing transparency and offering customers multiple delivery options—such as expedited shipping or flexible return policies—can go a long way in building trust and retaining loyalty.

Additionally, SMEs should take a proactive approach to managing customer stress during this busy time. Offering responsive customer service, including access to support channels like live chat or social media, can help mitigate frustration and enhance the overall shopping experience.

Leverage e-commerce and international growth.

Despite global economic challenges, many SMEs remain optimistic about the potential for e-commerce growth during the holiday season. In fact, many of the companies in my company's 2024 E-Commerce Survey expect their e-commerce sales to increase year-over-year, with social commerce expected to reach approximately $2 trillion by 2025. Moreover, international growth presents a significant opportunity, with markets like the EU, UK, Mexico and Canada offering new customer bases for businesses to tap into.

Diversifying into international markets not only opens revenue streams but also helps businesses spread risk by reducing reliance on one region. Companies should consider adjusting their marketing strategies to target international audiences and ensure they are prepared to navigate cross-border logistics and compliance.

Incorporate sustainable solutions.

Sustainability is becoming increasingly important to consumers, especially during the holiday season when shopping spikes. Another recent study from my company found that 59% of U.S. online shoppers consider sustainability ""very"" or ""quite"" important. This presents a unique challenge during peak season, when businesses must manage heightened demand while aligning with consumer values.

By offering transparency around sustainability efforts and providing greener packaging and delivery options businesses can differentiate themselves in a crowded market. During the holidays, when shipping volumes soar, incorporating sustainable practices not only supports the environment but also strengthens customer loyalty, as consumers gravitate towards brands that reflect their values.

Stay agile in a volatile environment.

The holiday season is filled with unpredictability, from sudden changes in consumer demand to supply chain disruptions. Businesses must remain agile and ready to pivot when needed. Partnering with logistics providers that can offer scalable solutions, such as additional aircraft or trucking rotations, will be vital to staying on top of fluctuating volumes.

In a rapidly changing market, businesses need to be ready for anything—whether it’s higher-than-expected volumes or global trade volatility. By staying informed, prepared and adaptable, companies can make the most of the holiday season and position themselves for long-term success.

213,2024-11-08 00:00:00,Canada’s West Coast Port Strike Causes Supply Chain Panic,"The West Coast ports handle about $576 million in daily trade and play a vital role in North America’s interconnected ports, railways, and trucking. However, a prolonged strike could throw a wrench in this well-oiled machine, causing ripple effects throughout the entire supply chain. getty

The holiday season is fast approaching. But this year’s excitement could be dampened by the threat of major trade disruptions due to ongoing port strikes, once again.

British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (BCMEA) locked out over 700 foremen at ports across British Columbia. This disruption coincides with an ongoing strike at the Port of Montreal - the largest port in eastern Canada - which has been already facing partial closures affecting 40% of its container traffic.

It’s not hard to see how shipping backlogs could pile up, which could potentially disrupt the important international shipments, causing serious economic headaches for businesses and consumers.

The ripple effect of the strike

The West Coast ports are a powerhouse, handling about $576 million in daily trade and playing a vital role in North America’s network of ports, railways, and trucking. However, a prolonged strike could throw a wrench in this well-oiled machine, causing ripple effects throughout the entire supply chain.

History serves as a reminder: Last month, a three-day strike involving over 47,000 dockworkers affected 36 U.S. ports, and while it was brief, the resulting backlog of ships waiting to unload cargo is expected to disrupt local and international supply chains for weeks.

Forbes Drug Shortages Create Surprising Opportunity For Pharma Supply Chain

With cargo activities already affected, vital international shipments are at risk, which could lead to significant economic losses for various industries. This situation may worsen shipping backlogs and bottlenecks for businesses, driving up transportation costs and potentially leading to shutdowns of plants and mills that depend on shipping to get their products out the door.

It’s not just the big players who will feel the heat. The small and medium-sized businesses are likely to be hit hardest due to lack of flexibility in contracts comparing to larger companies, making them more vulnerable to increased costs and delays when shipment plans change.

For distributors serving multiple retailers, even a small delay can mean they can’t meet their contractual obligations, which could lead to penalties.

While consumers might not notice immediate shortages on grocery shelves or in stores, if this labor dispute drags on for weeks, they may soon feel the impact as costs rise and availability dips.

Supply chain strategies behind fully stocked shelves

As this is not the first nor the last supply chain disruption, leveraging supply chain best practices is essential for effectively navigating these challenges. Here are what companies can do in a long and in a short time:

Enhancing visibility is essential for making informed and agile decisions. Rising costs linked to backlog are just one concern; unforeseen incidents can also occur. Because who would imagine a lithium-ion battery caused a fire after an overturned tractor trailer, which burned for several days and temporarily closed the ports? But with enhanced visibility companies can make quick and informed decisions to mitigate the impact of such unexpected events.

Forbes Digital Supply Chains: Bridging The Gap Between Vision And Reality

By integrating scenario planning, organizations can develop tailored strategic responses for various scenarios by analyzing historical data on strikes and other disruptions to understand their potential causes.

Re-routing and alternative shipping methods are widely used strategy. During US port strike in October, the Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd implemented local port surcharges for cargo moving to and from affected terminals. Some shipping lines began rerouting vessels to alternative ports, which resulted in longer transit times and additional shipping costs – but at least no disappointed customers. Instead of only using ocen freight, shifting to air cargo were it is feasable is a quick solution.

Cross-functional and clear communication is crucial in times of uncertainty because no business can do it alone. Providing regular updates about potential delays can help manage expectations and maintain customer relationships. Clear communication is crucial in times of uncertainty, ensuring that both suppliers and customers are informed about the situation. After all, who wants to see their order stuck in the same status for two weeks without any updates?

Inventory optimization strategies help buffer against supply chain interruptions by determining optimal stock levels for essential parts and products. By leveraging advanced and AI-driven demand forecasting tools, companies can better predict consumer needs and strategically position inventory closer to customers – so even if primary distribution channels are disrupted, businesses can fulfill orders quickly.

Behind those fully stocked shelves lies a network of well-balanced long- and short-term strategies that make it all possible. By taking proactive steps to mitigate the impact of strikes and such events, businesses can not only protect their interests but also contribute to a more stable and resilient supply chain ecosystem.

214,2024-11-08 17:54:00,Canada’s western ports are on lockdown: What to know,"Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

The British Columbia Maritime Employers Association locked out more than 700 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 514 on Nov. 4 after union workers staged a walkout at BCMEA member terminals.

The two sides met separately with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on Nov. 9, but no progress was made, according to an email from the BCMEA sent to Supply Chain Dive. No additional meetings were scheduled

Both parties have been in negotiations for nearly two years after the expiration of their contract on March 31, 2023. Most recently, the BCMEA presented ILWU Local 514 with its final offer on Oct. 30. The proposal includes a 19.2% salary increase over the next four years and an average $21,000 signing bonus.

While experts told Supply Chain Dive they expect minimal short-term impact on supply chains from the work stoppage — as imports from Vancouver can be re-routed to U.S. West Coast ports — a lengthier shutdown could prove damaging.

“If the work stoppage lasts for several weeks and more volume is diverted, we would expect equipment-availability issues impacting spot prices and some delays,” said Marc Iampieri, global co-leader of the logistics and transportation practice at AlixPartners.

State of operations

As of Nov. 6, there have been no changes to the coast-wide job action involving the ILWU Local 514 and BCMEA, according to the Port of Vancouver. The port remains open despite the disruptions at BCMEA member terminals. Impacted terminals include those in the automotive, breakbulk and container sectors.

All grain shipments and operations at the Westshore coal terminal are not affected by the lockout, according to the update, and most petroleum products are still on the move. In terms of rail, embargoes are in place, and the port advises shippers to contact railways directly for the most up-to-date information.

The Port of Prince Rupert is also experiencing disruptions, according to a Nov. 5 operational update, with two out of seven terminals being directly impacted. A port spokesperson told Supply Chain Dive that the Fairview Container Terminal, which focuses on intermodal containers, and the Westview Container Terminal, which handles wood pellets, cannot conduct business due to the stoppage.

In a Nov. 8 update, the Port of Prince Rupert detailed the various operational effects of the stoppage. At least one vessel's berthing has been delayed, and container vessel discharge has ground to a stop. Rail movements have also been impacted, averaging 12 trains per day since the labor disruption took effect. In the week leading up to the disruption, the Port of Prince Rupert averaged 14 trains per day.

On Nov. 2, Canadian Minister of Labour and Seniors Steven MacKinnon said on X that while federal mediators are onsite, it is the “responsibility of the parties to reach an agreement.”

Broader impacts

The Vancouver and Prince Rupert ports are some of the busiest in Canada. For context, the Port of Vancouver moved nearly the same amount of cargo as the country’s next five largest ports combined in 2023, Pina Melchionna, president and CEO of CITT – Canada’s Logistics Association, told Supply Chain Dive.

Canada’s western ports are also the largest exporters of potash, the trade name for potassium used for fertilizer, with a shutdown costing the industry $9.7 million per day in lost revenue, Melchionna added.

Products like coal and containerized freight, including crops and meats, may also be impacted, according to Ron Scalzo, senior managing director at FTI Consulting.

There could be a disruption to the flow of import products like footwear, apparel, auto parts, chemicals and lumber as well, Scalzo said. He further noted that Vancouver is a “critical” point of entry for perishable cargo like produce, seafood and dairy.

“My advice is to always accurately value your risk to supply shortages and the cost to mitigate them, and then to invest in having multiple options available when issues arise."" Marc Iampieri Global co-leader of the logistics and transportation practice at AlixPartners

Vancouver’s exports, including agricultural, energy and industrial commodities, won’t be too heavily impacted if the stoppage is quickly resolved, according to Iampieri. Grain exports are also safe due to Canada’s labor code.

To avoid severe disruptions, experts said shippers will likely shift volumes to U.S. West Coast ports like the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Seattle.

However, the North American supply chain is still recovering from the recent strike on the U.S. East and Gulf Coast ports, meaning any diverted volumes may prompt more backlog and longer dwell times at West Coast ports, Melchionna said.

Mitigation measures

With the holiday season fast approaching, having a contingency plan is critical to navigating the current port disruption, according to experts.

“My advice is to always accurately value your risk to supply shortages and the cost to mitigate them, and then to invest in having multiple options available when issues arise,” Iampieri said. “The better way to manage your supply chain is to invest in alternate/secondary suppliers, routings, and some ‘no-regrets’ inventory and to always be on the lookout for risks to make subtle adjustments to the plan.”

“The more you know the more options and lifelines you have when things come to a halt."" Pina Melchionna President and CEO of CITT – Canada’s Logistics Association

Besides having a diversified supply base and multiple routings for key trade lanes, disruptions can also be averted through supplier, customer and freight forwarder coordination, according to Iampieri. He noted that using alternate routes is the easiest short-term mitigation plan, but pulling some purchases forward can allow for more supply on hand.

Shippers should also have a “strong sounding board” of carriers, warehouse operators and other industry experts, Melchionna said. She also expects shippers to consider backup storage options to house completed products and materials that can’t move due to potential backlogs.

“The more you know the more options and lifelines you have when things come to a halt,” she said."

AI is transforming industries, reshaping how consumers, founders and leaders approach business operations—especially in supply chains. While AI holds great potential for improving efficiency, many companies face challenges in integration due to technical and organizational hurdles. In this post, we'll explore AI's impact on supply chains, its applications and how companies can begin leveraging it, addressing key questions throughout.

What Is AI?

Before diving deeper, it's essential to understand AI. It simulates human intelligence through machines to perform tasks like learning, problem-solving and decision-making. It includes technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision to enhance efficiency across industries.

According to Statista, the AI market grew to over $184 billion in 2024, a rise of nearly $50 billion from 2023. This rapid expansion is expected to continue, with the market projected to exceed $826 billion by 2030.

How AI Can Shape The Future Of Supply Chain Management

Having worked closely for a decade within the supply chain industry, I've observed several ways AI can transform the supply chain landscape. In my opinion, personalized AI assistants have a huge potential to reshape how supply chain leaders manage complex operations. Let's break these down:

1. Distributed Communication With Suppliers

Traditionally, supply chain leaders would manually handle interactions with multiple suppliers, a time-consuming and error-prone process. AI assistants could now automate these interactions, coordinating with suppliers across regions in real time.

For example, if a shipment delay occurs, the AI assistant can instantly engage with suppliers, propose alternative shipping options and ensure alignment on revised timelines. This ensures standardized communication and usage of consistent language and terms, further reducing the risk of miscommunication.

2. Automated Order Operations

By replacing manual purchase order (PO) creation with AI-driven automation in order management, supply chain leaders can simply prompt AI assistants with commands like, ""Create a PO for 500 units from Supplier X,"" and the AI will pull relevant data on pricing, order history and terms—generating and sending the PO instantly.

In high-volume industries like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and personal care, this automation helps teams manage complex procurement needs efficiently—ensuring they meet tight deadlines and adapt to changing demand.

3. No-Code Reporting

No-code reporting can empower supply chain leaders to access data insights without technical expertise. AI assistants can generate customized reports based on simple prompts, like, ""Show cost savings by supplier this quarter"" or, ""Analyze the environmental impact of our last 10 shipments."" This instant access to insights enables faster, data-driven decisions, improving supplier performance, order accuracy and sustainability tracking.

4. Risk Mitigation

Leveraging historical demand plans as a baseline, AI can forecast risks such as supplier delays, stock shortages or transportation disruptions. By analyzing these demand trends, AI can predict potential risks before they materialize, allowing supply chain leaders to proactively adjust procurement strategies.

For example, if AI predicts a surge in demand for certain products, it can recommend adjusting inventory levels or expediting orders from suppliers.

Challenges Implementing AI

As CPO of Suuchi, I've observed supply chain leaders in industries like FMCG and OEM facing challenges while implementing AI. Across these industries, common challenges include outdated systems, data silos and internal resistance to change despite AI's proven ability to enhance efficiency and profitability.

For example, an FMCG aggregator we worked with sought to leverage AI to reduce costs and improve margins but struggled with fragmented data across multiple systems. The inflexible ERP system further complicated efforts, as real-time integration of AI-driven insights required custom development, delaying the projected 4% reduction in landed costs and 3% margin improvements.

Similarly, a cosmetics company sought to use AI to reduce lead times and improve order accuracy. However, integrating AI with its customized manual order management system proved challenging. Technical limitations and employee resistance slowed its goal of cutting lead times by 30% and reducing order errors by 45%, delaying quicker product launches.

A Guide To AI Integration For Businesses

To fully maximize AI's benefits, organizations must encourage employee adoption. Here are key strategies for optimizing AI in supply chains:

Supply Chain Assessment

Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the supply chain before implementing AI. Determine the areas for improvement in the supply chain. To optimize the effectiveness of your AI technology, you must create and constantly adhere to goals.

Understand The Business Model

The starting point of AI integration is different for businesses and is often based on the respective business models. For instance, AI implementation in the e-commerce business enhances the efficiency of products, detects fraud, provides personalized experiences, assists customers automatically and adjusts prices according to market trends. Meanwhile, manufacturers implement AI to enhance efficiency and minimize disruption using predictive maintenance, automated production, real-time defect detection and data-driven demand forecasting.

Implement A Data Strategy

The majority of AI tools for the supply chain use prediction analytics, which needs the proper data. Ensure the information you have is well-organized, pristine and accurate. It may entail the reconciliation of disparate datasets, the correction of inaccuracies and the identification of external variables that may affect your supply chain.

Adapt A Phased Approach

Consider a gradual approach to AI integration into your supply chain. Launch a trial project that emphasizes a specific issue such as improving the operational efficiency of a warehouse or identifying indicators of client demand. It allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of AI, acquire knowledge and obtain essential information before a broader rollout.

Consider Professional Collaboration

Installing AI supply chain software independently may yield lower ROI. Collaborating with professionals can help set tangible goals, ensuring organizations can effectively measure and witness their return on investment.

Conclusion

216,NaN,"Mystery parcel fires were 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US, says Poland","Mystery fires were Russian 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US

Getty Images Germany's domestic intelligence says it was a stroke of fortune that a device in Leipzig had not ignited in mid-air (file pic)

A series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada, Polish prosecutors say. Katarzyna Calow-Jaszewska revealed late last month that four people had been arrested and authorities across Europe were investigating the incidents. Western security officials have now told US media they believe the fires - which happened in July - were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage. But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic.

Ms Calow-Jaszewska said in a statement that a group of foreign intelligence saboteurs had been involved in sending parcels containing hidden explosives and dangerous materials via courier companies. The parcels then spontaneously burst into flames or blew up. Western officials believe the fires originated in electric massage machines containing a ""magnesium-based"" substance. Magnesium-based fires are hard to put out, especially on board a plane. “The group’s goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada,” Ms Calow-Jaszewska said. Some of the devices originated in Lithuania, and prosecutor general Nida Grunskiene said there had been arrests there too. A pre-trial investigation was under way and law enforcement agencies from other countries were taking part, she told reporters. On three days in July, fires broke out in a container due to be loaded on to a DHL cargo plane in the German city of Leipzig, at a transport company near Warsaw, and at Minworth near Birmingham, UK, involving a package described as an incendiary device. The incident at Jablonow near Warsaw took two hours to extinguish, according to Polish reports. UK officials have given few details about the fire at Midpoint Way in Minworth on 22 July. A Met Police spokesperson confirmed that a counter-terrorism investigation was under way after a package at a commercial premises caught alight, adding that ""it was dealt with by staff and the local fire brigade"". Ken McCallum, head of the UK's domestic intelligence agency MI5, said last month that Russian secret agents had carried out ""arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness"" after the UK had helped Ukraine in Russia's war. His allegations were flatly rejected by the Kremlin. A spokesperson for the US Transportation Security Administration said in recent months they have put in place additional security measures for certain US-bound cargo flown in by US and foreign airlines. A US government official also added that there is no current active threat targeting US-bound flights."
217,2024-10-28 08:31:00,Amazon warns of West Coast capacity constraints,"Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

Amazon is experiencing tight capacity at some West Coast facilities due to high demand, the company said in an announcement to third-party sellers Thursday.

The constraints are leading to lengthier processing times for seller inventory at inbound shipping locations and palletized freight. ""We’re continuing to monitor the situation and are working hard to ensure your inventory is placed before your deals start,"" Amazon said.

The e-commerce giant said it is rerouting shipments to other regions to relieve capacity. It has also extended the automatic closure and abandoned shipment windows for shipments created between Aug. 7 and Oct. 31.

Dive Insight:

Ahead of the 2024 peak season, Amazon pushed sellers to bring products into its network earlier than last year to ensure fast delivery speeds during the holidays. Sellers that haven't done so may have to brace for delays due to Amazon's recent capacity constraints.

""The congestion primarily originates from the inefficiencies in Amazon's cross-dock network, where the distribution from national and regional cross-docks to fulfillment centers has been severely delayed, potentially adding weeks to standard inbound times,"" Jon Elder, founder and CEO of the Amazon seller consultancy Black Label Advisor, said in a LinkedIn post.

Amazon has pushed sellers to transport their inventory to its network in one of two ways this year, leading to the cross-docking inefficiencies, Rob Hahn, COO of Pattern and a former Amazon executive, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.

One method is by bringing inventory to Amazon's closest national cross-docking facility for a fee, after which Amazon distributes the products to different locations. Hahn said this creates an extra touch in the process and added lead times.

The other approach is for sellers to send inventory to multiple locations themselves to avoid the fee. This results in more less-than-truckload shipments for facilities to handle, as many sellers don't have the volume to fill up a truck destined for one particular regional facility, Hahn said.

""It has slowed down the efficiency in those buildings, which does have knock-on effects in the capacity of these buildings,"" Hahn said.

To ease capacity constraints, Amazon is also providing added incentive for sellers to ship their inventory to areas with more space available.

The company has temporarily reduced its inbound placement service fee for sellers using its ""minimal shipment splits"" plan — or sending inventory to a single location — if their products are going to the Eastern U.S., an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. The fee's rate range is now 5 cents lower per unit.

Even factoring in Amazon's efforts to mitigate the issue, sellers should have emergency inventory at third-party logistics locations on both the West Coast and East Coast to mitigate their exposure to Amazon-related delays, Elder said.

Larger sellers may look to use full truckload providers to get products in on time, while lower-volume businesses could opt to use parcel carriers for inbound shipping, even though it could lead to higher transportation expenses, according to Hahn.

""That's the cost of doing business this peak,"" Hahn said."

Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) is expected to publish its Q3 2024 results around October 31. We expect revenue for the quarter to come in at about $13.1 billion, roughly in line with consensus estimates and down about 8% compared to last year. We expect the company to post a net loss of $0.01 per share, slightly ahead of consensus estimates. See our analysis of Intel Earnings preview for a closer look at some trends that could drive Intel’s results.

In Q2 2024, Intel’s product revenue reached $11.8 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by stronger sales of its PC chipsets. However, the PC market softened in Q3, with global shipments down 1.3% year-over-year to 62.9 million units, according to Gartner. While Intel continues to face competition from AMD’s Ryzen line, which could impact growth, the company gained some share in the PC market last quarter, driven by growth in entry-level mobile CPUs for devices such as Chromebooks. On the server side, Intel has been facing pressure from AMD’s EPYC chips which have been gaining market share amidst Intel’s delays in transitioning to smaller process nodes. In Q2, Intel’s Data Center and AI sales fell 3%. While similar headwinds could persist into Q3 for Intel, the company could see some incremental upside from its Sapphire Rapids processors.

We will be closely watching the performance of Intel’s foundry business. Intel has been betting heavily on becoming a foundry player, producing chips for other semiconductor companies, and taking on the likes of TSMC and Samsung Electronics. Things haven’t gone smoothly for the business due to Intel’s missteps which caused it to outsource a considerable amount of wafer production for some of its latest chips. Although Intel doesn’t expect the business to break even until 2027, we will be looking for updates on the business.

Much of the success of the foundry business will hinge on Intel’s new 18A manufacturing process. While production on this process is expected to begin in 2025, Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones, noting that the chips made with this process had powered on, booted Windows, and were operational within Intel. Once Intel transitions its latest server and PC chips to this process node, ending its outsourcing of chips to TSMC, we could see higher utilization rates, which would help reduce costs. If the company executes well on its foundry plans and delivers compelling new CPU and GPU chips, Intel could see almost 3x upside. On the other hand, if it fails to execute, Intel stock could see a downside to $10 Intel has had some high-profile customer wins for the foundry business in recent months, to make AI chipsets for Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, as well as a reported $3 billion-plus win from the Pentagon.

The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

We believe that Intel’s valuation is reasonable, with the stock trading at just about 20x consensus 2025 earnings. Intel is getting much more serious about its cost cuts. The company intends to cut over 15% of its workforce, which could amount to over 15,000 layoffs while aiming to slash costs by as much as $10 billion by next year. This could help manage the company’s bottom line over the coming quarters as its next wave of CPU, GPU, and foundry bets begin to bear fruit.

AI has dominated the narrative in the tech industry post-Covid-19, leading to weaker demand for CPUs in PCs and general servers, which are Intel’s core business. However, a potential demand upcycle could emerge in the near-term, as companies and consumers refresh aging computers in the coming years. This would benefit Intel, which is expected to introduce its latest chips and advanced manufacturing technologies by then. We value Intel stock at about $30 per share presently, which is 35% ahead of the current market price of $22. See our analysis of Intel Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Intel. We also highlight the catalysts for Intel stock recovery in this analysis.

Dive Brief:

Bassett Furniture expects the impacts of Hurricane Helene and the International Longshoremen Association’s East and Gulf Coast port strike to “have a bearing” on its Q4 results, according to a Q3 2024 earnings call

The storm shut down one of Bassett’s distribution centers in Catawba County, North Carolina, for two days during the first week of October, CEO Rob Spilman told analysts. The CEO added that the strike pushed shipments back by one to two weeks.

“We've recovered as quickly as possible to get shipments back on track,” Spilman said, noting that storm damage to Interstate 40, the furniture retailer and manufacturer’s main route to the west, will have a larger longer-term impact on its logistics and distribution systems.

Dive Insight:

Extreme weather events and labor unrest have created a season of supply chain disruptions, impeding or even halting operations up and down the East and Gulf Coasts.

Hurricane Helene killed more than 200 people and uprooted roads and infrastructure across the Southeast, leading parcel carriers like FedEx and UPS to suspend or delay deliveries in some areas, among other disruptions.

Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton battered Florida, closing ports, flooding trucking routes and interrupting deliveries.

Meanwhile, although the ILA strike lasted only three days, its impact to supply chains is still being felt, leaving shippers to contend with cargo backlogs and freight constraints.

These recent events, however, are not the first supply chain disruptions Bassett has endured this year.

In July, a cyberattack led the company to suspend some of its manufacturing operations.

Bassett CFO Mike Daniel confirmed during the Q3 earnings call that the shutdown lasted for one week. Daniel noted that no consumer information was compromised and that the company was able to recover all data and resume full operations within two weeks of the attack. However, the CFO estimated the incident led to a loss of between $1 million and $2 million.

“So the efficiency in the pipeline and getting these loads built back and filling the trucks and getting them out there definitely affected our July and into August,” Spilman added, noting that the company operates a captive distribution center.

While navigating multiple supply chain disruptions, Bassett is undergoing a restructuring plan announced in July. The plan includes an ongoing consolidation of its manufacturing footprint and the exit of a West Coast wholesale distribution center, a move the company completed during Q3. Spilman said moving out of the facility resulted in a $1.2 million charge.

220,2024-10-11 00:00:00,Boeing Will Cut About 10% Of Its Workforce Amid Strike And Financial Struggles,"Topline

A whopping 10% of Boeing’s workforce will be gutted in the coming months, the aerospace company announced Friday, the latest sign of trouble for Boeing as it deals with billion-dollar losses and an ongoing factory strike.

Key Facts

Boeing said in its announcement it needs to reset its workforce levels to “align” with its “financial reality and to a more focused set of priorities,” noting executives, managers and employees will be affected by the layoffs. The layoffs will cut about 17,000 people from the company, CNBC reported. Boeing also announced production and delivery changes, saying it will delay deliveries of its new 777X long-range airplane until 2026 and stop producing its 767 freighters, planes primarily used for shipping goods, by 2027. The layoff news comes shortly after Boeing published preliminary third quarter results Friday, which revealed the company expects to report a loss of $9.97 a share. Boeing is also in the middle of a strike from more than 30,000 factory workers who sought a new contract earlier this week before pay talks eventually collapsed.

Tangent

Boeing shares are down nearly 2% in after hours trading this evening following a 3% jump from the stock that brought it up to $151.02 on Friday. The company’s stock is now down nearly 18% in the last three months.

Big Number

$10 billion. That is how much money Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein believes Boeing will burn through this year, potentially forcing it to issue $7 billion to $8 billion in stock next year to shore up losses.

What To Watch For

The drawn-out nature of the strike against Boeing could further threaten its plane delivery numbers. The aerospace company made 33 deliveries in September, down from 40 deliveries the prior month, according to Reuters, which noted the strike halted production of key revenue drivers in Boeing's 777 and 767 airplanes. The ongoing strike could very well continue, as Jon Holden, head of Lodge 751 of the International Association of Machinists, told Forbes last month the trade union is “going to push [Boeing] farther than they thought they would go.”

Key Background

Boeing has been under a harsh limelight since January, when a door plug on one of its airplanes blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight and provoked the Federal Aviation Administration to halt production expansion of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft. Production slumps have been exasperated by striking workers who are demanding pay raises and reached an impasse with the aerospace company this week. Union leaders accused Boeing of refusing to propose any wage increases while the company claimed it offered “increases in take-home pay and retirement.” Boeing is also under financial pressure following $1.4 billion in losses reported last quarter, a massive jump compared to the $149 million in losses it experienced in the same quarter a year prior. Boeing’s stock is around the lowest it has been all year, trading around $151 per share after starting 2024 at about $251 per share.

The International Longshoremen’s Association strike may have ended, but shippers are still facing cargo backlogs and freight constraints, experts told Supply Chain Dive.

After a three-day strike disrupted East and Gulf Coast port operations last week, the ILA and United States Maritime Alliance reached a tentative wage deal and agreed to extend their master contract until Jan. 15, 2025. The extension gives both parties some time to negotiate pending issues but if a master contract is not renewed by then, the union could go on strike again.

Shippers, however, are still dealing with lingering impacts from some of the terminal closures that took place during the work stoppage.

It will likely take most of October to get port operations back to normal due to the backlog of cargo and vessels caused by the strike, Vespucci Maritime Partner and CEO Lars Jensen wrote in an Oct. 7 LinkedIn post. “This will also create some ripples whereby we will see a temporary decline in capacity offered from Europe to North America,” Jensen wrote.

Before the union went on strike, some shippers diverted cargo to the West Coast and frontloaded goods to mitigate any potential impact to their supply chain operations. At the start of the strike, West Coast rail operations were strained due to high inland point intermodal volumes, according to ITS Logistics.

We asked six experts what impacts shippers are facing and what they need to focus on to better manage their freight and supply chains.

Editor’s Note: Some responses have been edited for length and clarity.

Nick Vyas

Founding Director of USC Marshall’s Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute

With the resolution of the U.S. East Coast port strike, shippers may experience a temporary sense of relief, but the logistical hurdles are far from over. The immediate focus is clearing the significant backlog of shipments, which could take weeks and continue to strain freight capacities. Elevated freight costs and ongoing congestion at both primary and alternative ports means that delays will persist, affecting inventory replenishment and supply chain reliability as businesses prepare for the critical holiday season. However, the bigger issue — the elephant in the room — is automation, which has been kicked down the road for now. By postponing the integration of advanced technologies into port operations, the nation risks undermining its competitiveness and efficiency on the global stage. This hesitation not only hampers the modernization of our ports but also presents a significant risk for companies considering onshoring their operations. If domestic logistics infrastructure cannot evolve to meet modern demands, businesses may seek more efficient environments elsewhere, leading to potential economic loss. To foster economic growth and maintain a competitive edge, it's imperative to address automation proactively, finding a balance that advances technological adoption while considering the workforce's needs.

Mia Ginter

Director of North American Ocean Shipping at C.H. Robinson

The U.S. port strike has ended, but the impacts are far from over. A week of disruption typically leads to at least a month of delays at the ports, and these delays increase as you move inland. As seen in the past, when port congestion and dwell time increases, equipment is tied up longer and rates tend to increase as equipment availability decreases. Keep in mind, the U.S. Southeast is also still recovering from Hurricane Helene. While truckload capacity currently remains steady and available across impacted regions, load-to-truck ratios are rising on the West Coast. We expect this to continue as rail delays linger, elevating the need for trucks and transloading services. Air freight and expedited LCL services will likely continue to play a role in helping move priority freight as the market recovers.

Ashley Craig

Chair of the International Trade Practice at Venable LLP

While the strike was relatively short, with the complexities of global supply chains, the impact is and will continue to be felt throughout many sectors. This is due to carriers diverting cargo in anticipation of the strike, the complete closure of all terminals on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts for multiple days - translating into holds, detentions, stoppages, etc. Additionally, questions remain as to the new surcharges, diversion costs and operational concerns triggered by the anticipated strike and the reality of three days downtime. Shippers, NVOCC’s, forwarders and others should understand what protections and liabilities arise from your contracts if the labor unrest disrupted business operations or ability to perform. Shippers should know what avenues for disputing charges are available and regulated entities should ensure they understand their regulatory obligations and are operating in strict compliance.

Richie Daigle

Supply Chain Evangelist at Tive

While we can all agree that complications and difficulties would have been much worse had the strike continued for a longer period of time, there will still be a considerable amount of work needed to adjust back [to] 'business as usual' all the while keeping in mind that another strike could resurface in early Q1. So, while companies can breathe easier in the short term, it's likely that most companies are aware that more disruptions could be on the way in the not-so-distant future. Whether hurricanes, strikes, pandemics or other unforeseen destabilizing events, sizable disruptions seem to be commonplace, making the need for a well thought out plan propped up by a thoughtful application of modern technology all the more necessary. Redundancies in tracking, elevated vetting of partners and a reliance on trusted relationships are a great place to start for building such plan.

Vikas Argod

Associate Principal of Supply Chain & Manufacturing at ZS

The backlog of ships created for every day of port closure takes three to five days to clear. Three days of closure will impact TATs (turnaround times) and other port operations for the next at least two weeks, if not more. This will impact imports and exports. This disruption will propagate upstream and downstream into truck / intermodal capacity. So, expect a truck rate spike in spot (~10%), and slightly higher labor overtime in warehouses and transloading centers. For a few weeks leading to the strike, many importers routed containers to West Coast ports. There is already an imbalance of empty containers across ports, and this will further add to the imbalance, resulting in empty container movements from West to Eastern shipper locations and takes additional spot freight capacity away and also might impact some container availability for shippers.

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect initial impacts of the storm and port operational statuses as of Thursday morning.

Hurricane Milton made landfall south of Tampa, Florida, Wednesday evening, bringing with it heavy rains and damaging winds that have interrupted supply chain operations in the state.

The Category 3 storm tore through eastern and central Florida overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center, which noted that the storm has moved into the Atlantic Ocean.

The Tampa Bay area will experience major impacts across port operations as well as road, rail and air traffic due to flooding, according to emailed comments Thursday from Jon Davis, chief meteorologist at Everstream Analytics.

Port operations disrupted

Port Tampa Bay ceased inbound and outbound vessel traffic and closed shipping channels ahead of the storm’s landfall, according to an Oct. 8 update.

Other major supply chain centers in Florida, including Miami and Jacksonville, as well as Savannah, Georgia, have faced more moderate impacts, according to Davis.

In preparation for the storm’s impact, Jacksonville Port Authority closed Wednesday and will remain closed today, the port said Wednesday. Landside operations at Port Everglades have resumed as of Thursday morning, though waterside operations remain suspended.

PortMiami resumed cargo operations on Thursday, according to a port notice.

Meanwhile, interior portions of the state are facing more “severe and extreme” impacts from flooding and wind damage, according to Davis.

Trucking routes flooded

Major roadways across the storm’s path, including Interstate 75, Interstate 275, Interstate 4, Interstate and Interstate 95 and Interstate 75, have been particularly affected, Davis said. In addition, rail lines and intermodal hubs are also in the “zone of highest risk.”

“When all is said and done, the length of disruptions in the hardest hit areas will likely be measured in weeks,” Davis said.

Depending on the breadth of the storm’s destruction, the trucking market in the state may tighten up as capacity is allocated to transporting basics like food and water and the resources to rebuild, Rick Jordon, senior managing director at FTI Consulting, said. With less available capacity and potential fuel supply disruptions, logistics costs, including trucking rates, could also spike.

Parcel carriers suspend some services

The parcel delivery sector is also feeling the effects of the storm. Carriers began preparing for the storm’s impact earlier this week, even as they continue sorting through service disruptions in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene.

In an Oct. 10 update, FedEx said that “delays and disruptions are possible for inbound and outbound shipments in markets along the west coast of Florida.” The carrier has also suspended service for its Express, Ground and Freight offerings across multiple Tampa area zip codes.

The United States Postal Service has temporarily shuttered retail and delivery options in the 326, 344, 328, 329 and 347 zip codes.

Meanwhile, UPS will continue providing pickup and delivery services but warned that delays are possible."
224,2024-10-08 00:00:00,Descartes Releases October Global Shipping Report: September 2024 U.S. Container Imports Mark Third Consecutive Month of Elevated Volumes,"ATLANTA —

Georgia, October 8, 2024 -- Descartes Systems Group, the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, released its October Global Shipping Report for logistics and supply chain professionals. The report shows that September U.S. container import volumes were 2,520,935 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), which marks the second time this year that volumes have eclipsed 2.5 million TEUs and the third month in a row that they have surpassed the 2.4 million TEU threshold that has historically strained U.S. maritime logistics. Despite another month of elevated volumes, port transit time delays decreased at the majority of top 10 U.S. ports. The October update of the logistics metrics monitored by Descartes reinforces the strength of U.S. container imports since the start of 2024; however, potential challenges associated with the recently resolved International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) strike and ongoing conflict in the Middle East may create pressure on global supply chains throughout the remainder of the year.

September 2024 U.S. container imports exceed 2.5M TEUs.

U.S. container import volumes in September 2024 were 2,520,935 TEUs. This marks a 1.7% increase over August 2024, a significant 14.4% rise compared to September of last year, and an impressive 23.5% increase over pre-pandemic September 2019. Over the first nine months of 2024, import volumes are 16.5% higher than the same period in 2019.

“Despite a third month of elevated container import volumes, port transit delays improved at the majority of the top 10 U.S. ports in September,” said Jackson Wood, Director, Industry Strategy at Descartes. “Imports from China are contributing to overall U.S. volumes, posting the three highest monthly volumes on record in July, August and now September.”
