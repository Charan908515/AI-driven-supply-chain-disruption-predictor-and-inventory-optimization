By 2011, regime created Hafez al-Assad passed son Bashar death 2000 already corrupt decadent. But system Hafez built still much brutal, ruthless strength believed necessary control Syria. Assad senior seized power country prone coups delivered son heir without significant challenge.

Bashar al-Assad vocal supporter Palestinians Hezbollah successful fight Israel 2006 Lebanon war. He younger ex soon former Arab leaders. Since father's death promising reform. Some Syrians still wanted believe 2011, hoping demonstrations spur needed change promised, ordered men shoot peaceful demonstrators dead streets. A British ambassador Syria told way understand Assad regime watch Mafia films like The Godfather. The obedient could rewarded. Anyone went head family closest lieutenants would eliminated.

When governments borrow capital markets, credit rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service Fitch Ratings (“Big Three”) issue sovereign credit ratings guide supply demand bonds. Sovereign credit ratings function like valves credit pipeline: higher rating, lower cost, faster transmission end-users. And vice versa. Are sovereign ratings biased economic growth Africa?

Governments special powers subjects. And credit rating agencies special powers governments rate. Sovereign ratings impact country’s entire supply chain credit, states, cities, banks, insurers, corporations, small enterprise, infrastructure, educational institutions, consumers, knock-on effects labor, fiscal development national wealth.

Creditors world rely credit ratings evaluate price bonds—some choice, others regulation. One sometimes hears investors say don’t consider ratings, view ignores real market dynamics. Credit ratings connect supply demand market clearing price. Most investors price-takers. The times prices ratings decouple whole market disbelieves rating, demand thin.

Blame Africa, Or Credit Rating Models?

For several years running, Big Three serially downgraded African government debt. In response, coalition African economic political leaders become increasingly vocal consider bias ratings. In September 2023, African Union threw weight behind plan launch pan-African credit rating agency (now scheduled mid-2025) issue domestic credit risk ratings bring local perspective dialogue.

Reuters broke news. The article said Big Three deny bias claim “follow formula across continents.” This summer, follow-on Reuters article succinctly summarized Africa’s predicament: “optimism faded, washed away deluge debt.”

Reuters blamed Africa.

After interviewing “dozens” rating agency employees, ex-employees large private creditors, reviewing “hundreds” pages legal documents, Reuters said found evidence systemic bias—only certain unpreparedness rate poor countries lacking familiarity credit rating processes.

These justifications strain credulity. The Big Three global centenarian giants weathered many economic cycles, whose annual revenues match exceed GDP African countries. Neither inexperienced under-resourced, simply run businesses see fit.

Choice Architecture In Credit Models: Hidden Bias

It factually incorrect claim documentary evidence bias exists. Senior sovereign credit rating analyst declarations existence bias searched found publicly. Moreover, growing academic literature documents Africa systematically overpays credit access, ratings punish Africa rewarding countries investing capacity, merits serious attention.

When I interviewed Reuters article, I raised choice architecture source bias: gamification outcomes filtering content could change (bias) outcome. The journalist consider points “real-world” chose include them.

I shared blog Reuters, whose spokesperson commented: We stand reporting fully met standards independence, accuracy impartiality Reuters Trust principles.

But choice architecture real-world concern manner credit ratings. The Big Three’s defense, formula sovereign ratings uniformly applied sovereign ratings everywhere, perfect example. Far showing consistency absence bias, illustrates fallacy composition, assumes true one member collective (rated sovereigns) true members.

Moreover, diametrical opposite I taught Moody’s analyst Asia Asian Crisis. We told positively culture, history, law psychology role borrowers service debts. We urged, analysts, go beyond personal, social cognitive biases order assess real repayment likelihood. I transmitted learning 2011 manual I wrote Hong Kong’s first credit rating agency analyst examinations.

To reach clear determination, case needed re-analyzed scratch produce independent rating judgment could compared original rating agency rating. It was—is—the way ascertain rating impropriety, including bias.

But GFC Pandemic, African economies entered downturn interest costs rose. Surpluses fiscal social reinvestment dwindled. National finances fragilized. Waves sovereign downgrades followed.

Africa's Middle Income Trap visualized World Bank - World Development Indicators

Too rich concessionary financial support past, African governments fell back limited domestic capital sources. It classic middle-income trap, spring-pin credit ratings, however unintended, worked Africa’s economic growth.

A Fine Line Between Bias And Discrimination

In 2008, Ghana’s domestic long-term interest rate 12%. In 2024, stands 29.85%. Nigeria’s 9.75% 2008, 6.25% 2010. Now 27.5%.

Now startup California Thermodynamics offering miniature nuclear reactors produce synthetic fuel site replacing everything diesel Jet A1, removing need entire supply chain making bases self-sufficient.

Return Of The Water Boiler

The underlying technology dates back earliest days nuclear age Aqueous Homogenous Reactors (AHRs) otherwise known “water boilers” developed 1940s. The AHR simple design consisting solution uranium salts water, circulating inner reactor chamber outer cooling chamber.

The advantage setup safe. While reactors rely control rods lead overheating removed, AHR self-regulating. It also highly efficient produces less waste types.

The disadvantages include corrosion reactive uranium compounds rapidly eats away metal reactor walls, low power output compared reactor designs. In addition heat, AHR produces hydrogen by-product; creates explosion hazard.

By 1950s, AHRs still interest scientific laboratories high neutron flux produced could harnessed make nuclear isotopes. Overall though qualities needed large-scale power plants, AHRs pushed aside complex types like Pressurized Water Reactor generates world’s nuclear electricity.

The new AHR design negates problems 3D-printed containment vessel made novel, patent-pending material susceptible corrosion. And hazardous output hydrogen gas turned asset.

“We taking historic problem AHRs, namely excessive hydrogen production, using advantage. Our design cost effective, carbon friendly way make hydrogen earth,” Stephen Boyd, California Thermodynamics co-founder CTO, told me.

The new design miniature reactor fits standard military pallet produces 22.4 liters (0.8 gallons) hydrogen gas per minute. Converting hydrogen liquid hydrocarbon fuel using Fischer-Tropsch reaction developed 1930s already mature technology, additional ingredient carbon dioxide. A base would array reactors, possibly hundred thousands depending requirements. These provide far power per unit area wind solar arrays, making compact defensible.

Most importantly, rather making electricity, new design gives base bottomless fuel reserve liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

“Nuclear powered fuel synthesis represents next frontier high performance fuels, produced point demand even remote locations,” says Dan Sutton, CEO startup Synergetic produces synthetic fuels commercially. “From forward operating bases Mars.”

Synergetic’s technology enables production synthetic fuels directly substituted diesel, gasoline, aviation fuel.

Jennnifer “JJ” Snow, former Chief Technology Officer Air Force’s AFWERX drives innovation, believes new AHR approach potential.

“The concept Cal Thermo put forward would game changer expeditionary operations,” says Snow. “Providing power fuel austere environment persistent challenge. Cal Thermo changes traditional expeditionary logistics allowing forces deploy move solution power footprint keep fueled without risking additional assets.”

If watched news past summer, likely saw recalls deli meats poultry products. Multiple companies recalled millions pounds food recent months due connection nationwide listeria outbreak.

The government keeping close eye happening. Data released Centers Disease Control Prevention shows increased detection certain foodborne pathogens. That data, combined summer’s major recalls, incredibly unfortunate examples U.S. Food Drug Administration focused ""overhaul"" food supply system.

Starting January 2026, companies part producing, processing, packing holding food items required keep thorough records food traceability (though exemptions). Aimed enhancing food safety accelerating response times foodborne illness epidemics, new ruling part Food Safety Modernization Act often known FSMA 204 Rule 204. These companies must keep track ""key data elements"" ""critical tracking events"" foods Food Traceability List. They’re also required share information supply chain partners, ensuring parties aware food last handled.

While Rule 204 FSMA sounds ideal consumers, means companies need make necessary upgrades. Restaurants, even part broader supply chain, need prepared upcoming changes. While 2026 might sound far off, haven’t educated team started process updating systems, need respond sooner rather later.

Why These New Standards Are Necessary

In addition recent listeria outbreak, 400 cases salmonella linked cucumbers grown Florida, nearly 300 coffee products recalled concerns botulism contamination. At time writing, 250 recalls, market withdrawals safety alerts 2024 alone, according FDA data.

Situations like lead public lose faith food supply chain. The rule designed ensure improved traceability force suppliers held accountable, reduce number impact future outbreaks protect health consumers.

And restaurants (and grocery stores) usually final stop supply chain products reach consumer, still need diligent efforts protect health customers respect food supply. When people come us, expect get fresh, delicious safe meal. With high-profile outbreaks foodborne illnesses, consumers often expect stricter safety standards—and brands must ready meet demands.

Steps Restaurants Can Take To Prepare For Compliance

To ensure compliance Rule 204, retail food businesses, including restaurants, must meet certain record-keeping requirements products sell Food Traceability List. To successfully, incorporate following:

Analyze established systems.

First, conduct internal audit fully understand currently identify FTL products. Look areas improvement processes don’t meet requirements Rule 204. This information guide developing traceability plan bring operations recordkeeping code.

Embrace technology.

An efficient way tracking food supply using radio frequency identification labels. Also known smart labels, allow document trace individual products maintain inventory. These labels custom markers online access, permitting information shared requested, help ensure compliance.

Provide employee training.

Stress importance FSMA employees. Help understand role responsibilities ensuring compliance, make sure they’re trained new systems you’ve put place. Consider periodically hosting routine refresher training sessions ensure entire team stays aligned.

Collaborate suppliers distributors.

Beyond staff, work closely distributor partners, vendors suppliers help ensure every product properly tracked production point-of-sale partners. Data sharing accurate recordkeeping help everyone stay accountable aligned, reduce risk foodborne illnesses enable fast responses concerns.

Stay focused.

Unfortunately, “set forget it” situation. You continue review systems conduct internal audits assess efficiency traceability plan. Keep mind things progress, FDA may follow additional updates requirements. You’ll need make sure protocols align FDA requests.

Why Start Now

Delaying something last minute rarely works out. Sure, people respond well pressure looming deadline. As saying goes, “No pressure, diamonds.” But instance, ahead curve advantage.

Getting systems updated gives opportunity iron wrinkles January 2026. Also, it’s secret necessary upgrades going cost money. Starting allows better budget overall investment.

Until past years, food industry hasn’t always early adopter new technologies. Compared retail manufacturing businesses, we’ve relied traditional methods manage operations. However, recent years, we’ve made incredible strides catching industry counterparts.

All change may seem like lot, reality, it’s nature business today’s regulatory climate environment. Learning pivot strategy, systems policies help protect restaurant, even uncertain times. And case, embracing change could help protect customers well.

The big question is, how? Advances artificial intelligence data science hold key.

Visibility Across Global Value Chains

The data build bottoms-up view global supply chain network ability trace explore specific product value chains exists. It doesn’t exist one place, anything close that. Instead, it’s scattered siloed across globe, many different languages data types, much first-party. But artificial intelligence, it’s possible process data render single clean, unified dynamic view world’s interconnected supply chains.

But requires pooling everyone’s sensitive data learning, right? Not anymore. Through federated computing machine learning, possible overcome limitations sharing data, making learning across data silos possibility.

Federated learning makes possible render dynamic, intelligent, universal map entire global supply chain using first-party intelligence networked participants, ensuring data privacy, security sovereignty participants. The result shared source truth global supply chain, informed data many world’s largest organizations, without sharing anyone’s data.

Mastering Your Value Chains

Visibility start. The organizations benefit paradigm shift truly master value chains. The combination new regulatory incentives emerging technology allows organizations take command upstream downstream visibility, collaboration action. This possible shared source truth value chains governed across security, sustainability, labor rights, resilience, supply demand.

This implies new way organizing working across teams every business. Today, teams siloed across design engineering, sourcing, procurement, sales, logistics, compliance, sustainability, global trade management, risk management finance. Taking control value chains requires input action stakeholders. And need common operating picture collaborate.

Unfortunately, business processes—and software applications supporting them—are designed manage value chains. Most software applications can’t even represent concept value chains—just items, orders inventories, direct suppliers customers both. The whole ecosystem designed around direct buyer-supplier relationships.

Design sourcing teams need know front whether product they’re making sourced lawfully, tariff rates apply every market carbon footprint be. Risk managers compliance teams need work supplier managers engage upstream suppliers, remediate compliance exposures document regulators, transfer risks insurance marketplace.

Finance needs work supply chain logistics teams understand potential business interruption risks, exposure fines carbon border taxes. Executives need able ask question, ""What would impact business—our sales supplies—if particular country invades another?""

It equally essential companies work entirely new ways externally—sharing information coordinating across direct indirect buyers suppliers government stakeholders. In fact, legally obliged so.

Mastering value chains requires explicit information sharing, coordination standard-setting beyond direct buyer supplier relationships. The whole chain raw materials intermediate goods final assembly consumption need networked.

Businesses required gather share data across multi-tier value chain partners. They also need share information governments. Governments taking steps share view world private sector manage defense industrial base, secure critical infrastructure manage borders. Insurers lenders need know value chain order price risk comply regulations.

The upside government-compelled change offers fundamentally sustainable, resilient secure model managing global businesses. The possibilities enormous. By mastering value chains, businesses coordinate supply demand. The carbon impact individual products measured accurately reduced.

Critical Western technology kept wrong hands, doesn’t make way foreign hostile drones missiles. And government business collaborate across shared source truth ensure trade efficient secure.

In short, mastering value chains, businesses cake eat too: They enjoy security, reliability coordination vertical integration without needing entire value chain. We preserve benefits globalization addressing side effects unintended consequences.

But one major retailer admitted using Chinese tomatoes. Lidl told us another version Baresa Tomatenmark - made Italian supplier Giaguaro - sold Germany last year “for short time” supply problems investigating this. Giaguaro said suppliers respected workers' rights currently using Chinese tomatoes Lidl products.

The reporter’s undercover camera also captured crucial detail - dozen blue barrels tomato paste lined inside factory.

This firm “did engage forced labour”, Petti told us. However investigation found Bazhou Red Fruit shares phone number Xinjiang Guannong, evidence, including shipping data analysis, suggests Bazhou shell company. Petti added that: “In future import tomato products China enhance monitoring suppliers ensure compliance human workers’ rights.” While US introduced strict legislation ban Xinjiang exports, Europe UK take softer approach, allowing companies simply self-regulate ensure forced labour used supply chains. This set change EU, committed stronger laws, says Chloe Cranston, NGO Anti-Slavery International. But warns make even likely UK become “a dumping ground” forced labour products.","{

The company introduced Nap Dress 2019, design leaned idea smocked fabric 1950s reimagined modern, universal appeal. It take long dress – 50 designs – go viral social media become common many closets around world.

""Our crazy growth happened 2019 2020 – right middle quarantine I pregnant twins,"" CEO Nell Diamond tells BBC. ""I could obviously see much business changing internally sales volume, one really pivotal moment working home, sitting bedroom New York City, looking window see someone walking street wearing one dresses.

EXECUTIVE LOUNGE The BBC's series features interviews executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape future business – paving path leaders thrive. Read conversations here.

""Entrepreneurship feel really lonely insular, realise people know little project incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget moment.""

Since then, company sold one million Nap Dresses, expanded categories like outerwear swimwear, opened five retail locations across United States, New York Charleston. The brand's reach also expanded within retailers, including Shopbop Saks. Hill House puts current valuation approximately $150m (£118m), although BBC unable obtain independent valuation.

The company faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions pandemic scaling operations meet increased demand. But time small businesses struggle stand amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores importance adaptability building strong connections consumers.

""We've biggest year company history,"" Diamond said. ""The business continued grow past even optimistic plans.""

When told customers happening, people loved insight humanity behind products they're actually buying

Diamond's love fashion started early, teenage years attending American School London, UK. After graduating Princeton University, joined trading desk finance firm, initially entering sector business father Bob Diamond, former CEO Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, passion lay elsewhere.

""I always drawn retail,"" says. ""I'd steal friends' equity research papers learn companies retail space. I realised thing started guilty pleasure – loving fashion – turned viable career opportunity.""

Now, CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect business, growth strategy creative direction. Below, talks BBC company's biggest challenges, rapid evolution lifestyle brand plans future.

I wanted bring design-forward point view home category. We started home products: bedding, pillows, little bit pyjamas robes. But I really focused home and, particular, bedroom, drawing design elements London upbringing – great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax Fowler amazing prints I seen Victoria Albert Museum.

There many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] talking cutting middleman. I wanted thing … start small focus one two products. While I business school, I spent time little parts starting business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring first contractors setting Instagram account. After graduating, I spent first couple years bootstrapping business really focusing meeting customers. It small team co-working space New York City.

By 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went low slow careful growth success Nap Dress. Within months, business majority fashion business based strength one product line. We went five people 30 people one store almost six stores. It really changed scale business. I remember first order hundred units petrified actually sell them. To sold million really crazy.

Hill House Home The Nap Dress proved wildly popular consumers, new collections often selling minutes going sale (Credit: Hill House Home)

Why think one particular product, Nap Dress, resonates many people?

It's many different things. We invent smocking, makes dresses identifiable. My grandmother wearing smock dresses 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking terry cloth 2000s. But I think important us figuring proprietary type smocking could stretch you. I wore throughout twin pregnancy snap back. It works changing body throughout day – feels comfortable still look kind put together.

When first launched Nap Dress, would somebody email say: ""Oh, friend wearing dress dinner party, work preschool pickup, I it."" It exacerbated social media, organic social media, important distinction there. Even today, 30% orders site come word-of-mouth referrals.

What challenges faced early days overcome?

There – continues – challenges every day. Early certainly Covid, constant disruptions global supply chain, whether one factory shut another one delayed shipping.

In 2021, expected we'd able products certain date product drop. There crazy delays ports due shipping freight issues. That affect entire summer selling, entire quarter selling. In increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, easy forget many human touch points fragile be. We internally would get anxious nervous time one human touch points blockage.

But told customers happening, people loved insight humanity behind products they're actually buying. I think made feel personal them. And might one many reasons loyal customer base – let side business. It's clear robotic transactional.

How check manufacturing partners suppliers abiding highest standards?

We manufacturers 12 countries across nearly continents. It's tracking every stage development process. We take seriously. We work organisation called Transparency One helps us track across supply chain every stage audit manufacturers reporting. We've many manufacturers since day one developed human relationships people make clothes. One main manufacturers person sent first hundred unit orders to, feel tremendous amount ownership growth we've seen past couple years.

You've publicly said business reliant global trading routes global supply chains. Now given President-elect Trump campaigned raising tariffs imports, concerned might affect costs global trade generally?

I speak company, I think tariffs certainly something thinking about.

By numbers 1 million nap dresses sold 50 styles Nap Dress 5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas 80 employees ~$150m valuation

How expanding brand?

We concept called Nells store Charleston, South Carolina, inspired British upbringing. It's pick-and-mix candy station, there's coffee fountain soda bar, nod Americana roots brand well. It's never easier shop online, asking customers come store, delivering experience makes worth it.

The home category still really big us now. But seems small comparison fashion doing. A new category recently launched swim – that's performing really well. We asked else customers wanted see Hill House, swim early answer.

The fashion world notoriously fickle. How ensure products remain relevant across changes fashion street?

We focus core customer, I'm worried what's relevant anyone except them. It easy fashion get caught trend cycle, core customer really focused cute clothes make feel great carry different things day. Within formula, deliver product makes happy focused constant cycle newness. It's building pieces last wardrobe.

I always talk putting mute button real life, too, something's serving way

What advice smaller businesses hoping expand build?

One important pieces advice I got I first starting keep blinders on. I remember constantly playing comparison game early days looking brands, Instagrams advertisements stores, thinking: ""We done done this, can't that?"" That never productive me.

I real unlock I started tune noise focus going internally make good possibly could be. I mute lot people Instagram I'm getting negative feeling it. I always talk putting mute button real life, too, something's serving way.

Where see Hill House next years? Do think Nap Dress always centerpiece business?

My perception Nap Dress always hero product us. But growth right coming new products, categories retail channel. It's really exciting I think customers given us permission go rooms home activities they're swim outerwear.

I'm also incredibly bullish retail. I would love open stores. We're much one-year-at-a-time brand, I'd like start couple more. But customer led, I'll let tell us [what's next].

It could also lead higher prices Americans, since tariffs work form tax imports.

The US world's largest importer. China, Mexico Canada account 40% $3.2tn (£2.6tn) goods imports year, according official data. China defended efforts stop flow illegal drugs, warned winner trade war two. After Trump made tariff threat, spoke Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 10 minutes, discussing trade border security, Canadian government official told BBC. They ""good discussion"", source said. During call, Trudeau pointed number migrants crossing Canadian border much smaller compared US-Mexico border, official said. Mexico's finance ministry said: ""Mexico United States' top trade partner, USMCA provides framework certainty national international investors.""

The measures potential cause disruptions global supply chain would hit three countries targeted tariffs hard. The tariffs Mexico Canada remain place two countries clamp drugs, particularly fentanyl, migrants illegally crossing border, Trump said post Truth Social platform. ""Both Mexico Canada absolute right power easily solve long simmering problem,"" wrote. ""It time pay big price!"" In follow-up Truth Social post, Trump attacked Beijing failing follow promises said Chinese officials made carry death penalty people caught dealing fentanyl, synthetic opioid. A spokesperson Chinese embassy Washington told BBC ""the idea China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors flow United States runs completely counter facts reality"". ""China believes China-US economic trade cooperation mutually beneficial nature. No one win trade war tariff war,"" added. The Biden administration calling Beijing stop production ingredients used fentanyl, Washington estimates killed almost 75,000 Americans last year. During election campaign, Trump threatened Mexico China tariffs 100%, deemed necessary, much higher put place first term office. Trump also said end China's most-favoured-nation trading status US - advantageous terms Washington offers tariffs restrictions. Last year, 80% Mexico's exports went US, around 75% Canada's went southern neighbour. Even years bitter trade dispute world's two biggest economies, US still accounts 15% China's exports.

How tariffs work?

A tariff domestic tax levied goods enter country, proportional value import. So car imported US value $50,000 subject 25% tariff, would face $12,500 charge. Tariffs central part Trump's economic vision - sees way growing US economy, protecting jobs raising tax revenue. He previously claimed taxes ""not going cost you, it’s cost another country"". This almost universally regarded economists misleading. The charge physically paid domestic company imports goods, foreign company exports them. So, sense, straightforward tax paid domestic US firms US government. Trump imposed number tariffs first term office, many kept place successor, President Joe Biden. Economic studies suggest economic burden ultimately borne US consumers. It immediately clear whether Trump's ""additional 10% tariff, additional tariffs"" earmarked China top 25% planning Canada Mexico.

What Trump's strategy?

The move ""clearly consistent promise made campaign utilise tariffs weapon accomplish many policy initiatives,"" Stephen Roach, Senior Fellow Paul Tsai China Center Yale Law School, told BBC's Business Today programme. Trump's pick Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, previously suggested president-elect's threats impose major tariff hikes part negotiating strategy. “My general view end day, he's free trader,"" Bessent said Trump interview Financial Times nominated role. “It’s escalate de-escalate.” It comes Chinese economy significantly vulnerable position previous Trump presidency. The country struggling number serious issues, including ongoing property market crisis, weak domestic demand growing local government debt. The new tariffs appear break terms US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade. The deal, Trump signed law, took effect 2020. It continued largely duty-free trading relationship three neighbouring countries. Outside official reaction three countries affected, response critical.

President-elect Donald Trump Monday promised massive hikes tariffs goods coming Mexico, Canada China starting first day administration, policy could sharply increase costs American businesses consumers.

The move, Trump said, retaliation illegal immigration “crime drugs” coming across border.

“On January 20th, one many first Executive Orders, I sign necessary documents charge Mexico Canada 25% Tariff ALL products coming United States, ridiculous Open Borders,” Trump posted Truth Social platform. “This Tariff remain effect time Drugs, particular Fentanyl, Illegal Aliens stop Invasion Country!”

Trump said America’s neighbors “easily solve long simmering problem.”

Similarly, Trump said China face higher tariffs goods – 10% existing tariffs – prevents flow illegal drugs United States.

“I many talks China massive amounts drugs, particular Fentanyl, sent United States – But avail,” Trump posted Truth Social.

The president-elect claimed post Chinese officials promised country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs United States “never followed through.”

Responding Trump’s announcement, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said country communication US counternarcotics operations “the idea China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors flow United States runs completely counter facts reality.”

“About issue US tariffs China, China believes China-Us economic trade cooperation mutually beneficial nature. No one win trade war tariff war,” Liu said statement CNN.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum responded Tuesday, warning president-elect “neither threats tariffs solve issue migration drug consumption.”

“Imposing one tariff would mean another comes response, continuing like put shared companies risk,” said, reading letter addressed Trump.

Canadian officials responded announcement statement posted X Monday night, saying country “places highest priority border security integrity shared border” “essential US domestic energy supply.”

“We course continue discuss issues incoming administration,” Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said statement.

A significant policy change

The punishing tariffs, enacted, could wreak havoc America’s supply chains industries reliant goods country’s closest trading partners.

“The measures proposed evening could hit number strategic US industrial sectors hard, add approximately $272 billion year tax burdens, raise goods prices, lift interest rates, sap strength already-vulnerable household sector,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist Corpay Cross-Border Solutions.

Immediately announcement, Canadian dollar fell 1.2% US dollar, Mexican peso fell 2% dollar, recovered losses Tuesday morning. China’s yuan, though controlled government, traded higher – 7.6% – offshore markets.

Although investors believed tariffs could ultimately strengthen dollar, America’s financial markets took hit, too. The extraordinary tariffs would raise costs dramatically Americans everyday goods previously come border without import taxes.

That stunning shift could stymie economic growth, especially inflation-weary consumers spend less face higher costs.

The Dow fell 50 points, 0.1%, Tuesday. The broader S&P 500 Nasdaq slightly higher.

What America imports

The United States’ top import Canada oil, reached record 4.3 million barrels per day July, according US Energy Information Administration. America also imports cars, machinery various commodities, plastics wood Canada, according United Nations’ Comtrade.

Many US imports Canada Mexico exempted tariffs USMCA trade agreement three nations Trump pushed first administration. It’s clear Trump would plan implement proposed tariffs without violating USMCA.

Trump routinely referenced passage USMCA, replaced NAFTA, political victory highlight presidency.

Trump’s tariff plan

Trump campaigned using tariffs cudgel foreign countries – first administration – grow domestic manufacturing increasing tax revenue pay large revenue gaps proposed tax cut plan would create.

Tariffs effectively serve tax goods imported United States. Although Trump repeatedly said targeted foreign countries pay tariffs, fact paid companies purchase imported goods – costs typically passed onto American consumers. Most mainstream economists believe tariffs inflationary, Peterson Institute International Economics estimated Trump’s proposed tariffs (before new tariffs announced Monday night) would cost typical US household $2,600 year.

Scott Bessent, Trump’s pick Treasury secretary, said tariffs would add inflation implemented correctly. Wall Street cheered Bessent’s appointment, widely expected roll tariffs gradually.

Although Bessent, confirmed Senate, partly responsible implementing tariffs, coordination Commerce secretary US Trade Representative, Trump president would wield significant power levy tariffs stroke pen. He last White House, placing large tariffs goods, primarily China.

The problem tariffs often result retaliatory actions targeted countries, kicking trade war – that’s exactly happened Trump’s first term. That blunted tariffs’ effect domestic manufacturing, manufacturers’ goods became less attractive overseas buyers.

Trump promised significantly larger tariffs second term. Although continues discuss many different numbers, proposed tariff upward 60% Chinese goods, well across-the-board tariff either 10% 20% imports US.

Companies economists warn President-elect Donald Trump’s plans slap tariffs US imports cause havoc supply chains raise prices customers. But TJ Maxx believes Trump’s tariff plans benefit discount chain.

TJX, parent company TJ Maxx, Marshalls HomeGoods, said Wednesday “chaos” Trump’s tariffs may bring retail industry plays right business model. Tariffs taxes placed imported goods designed protect domestic manufacturers. Companies import products pay taxes typically pass extra cost customers form higher prices.

Unlike brands retailers, TJX says imports small, undisclosed percentage merchandise factories overseas. Instead, TJX relies mostly buying designer brands’ excess merchandise straight brands, much it’s already imported — selling customers anywhere 20% 60% regular prices. TJX’s “opportunistic buying” strategy capitalizes supply chain disruptions, canceled orders overproduction. And item already US, potential tariff would already paid first importer.

TJX believes Trump’s planned tariffs create opportunities scoop designer goods companies race bring products early avoid tariffs. More goods expected imported US normal remainder year retailers face potential resumption East Coast port strike, well tariff increases, National Retail Federation said earlier month. Imports forecast grow 13.6% November last year 6.1% December.

“Manufacturers could bring goods early,” TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said earnings call analysts Wednesday following company’s strong sales profit growth latest quarter. “That could create even additional availability goods advantageous prices us.”

“That’s likely scenario anything,” said.

That’s exactly happened TJX 2019, Trump administration hiked tariffs 25% $200 billion worth Chinese goods. Herrman said time tariffs created “buying opportunities” TJX.

TJX’s message tariffs stands sharp contrast retailers rely imported products. Walmart Lowe’s said week may raise prices Trump’s tariffs take effect, companies like Steve Madden speeding plans move production China.

“Our model everyday low prices. But probably cases prices go consumers,” Walmart finance chief John David Rainey said interview CNBC.

In today's interconnected global economy, landscape supply chains constantly evolving. From pressures pandemic rise digital technologies growing emphasis sustainability, supply chain professionals facing many challenges opportunities.

I'm going discuss trends expectations along concerns top mind executives, introducing next-generation solutions shaping future supply chain management.

State Of The Supply Chain

The disruptions due Covid-19 pandemic served wake-up call many organizations, highlighting vulnerabilities inherent complex, global supply chains. This led notable shift toward reshoring nearshoring production closer consumer markets.

As companies reevaluate reliance distant suppliers offshore manufacturing, strategy aims build resilient supply chains capable withstanding disruptions like natural disasters, geopolitical tensions pandemics.

McKinsey & Company reports 92% surveyed companies taken steps improve supply chain resilience, many relocating production closer home mitigate impact future disruptions similar experienced pandemic.

Digital transformation another key focus area, adoption technologies Internet Things (IoT), blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) data analytics accelerating rapidly.

As Accenture notes, leading companies investing heavily AI advanced analytics drive value supply chains, driving competition adopt implement digital transformation strategy. These technologies enhance visibility, efficiency decision-making within supply chains, addressing growing demand end-to-end visibility traceability driven factors product recalls, food safety concerns counterfeit goods.

Furthermore, sustainability ethical sourcing also spotlight, driven consumer demand regulatory pressure. Companies expected reduce carbon footprint, promote fair labor practices ensure responsible sourcing materials.

This shift toward sustainability also closely tied revived focus supplier relationship management organizations strive strengthen relationships key suppliers improve reliability, transparency collaboration—often closer integration shared risk management initiatives.

Top Concerns Of Top Executives

Against backdrop change, top executives grappling host concerns related supply chain management. Chief among concerns risk management, organizations seek ensure resilience disruptions ranging natural disasters cyberattacks supplier bankruptcies.

Hand hand managing risk data security supplier reliability concerns. Organizations must prioritize protecting sensitive information cyber threats digitalization continues spread end end supply chain. With interconnectedness, focus suppliers, too, meet quality standards, adhere regulatory requirements fulfill contracted services.

Compliance regulatory standards labor laws another overarching theme touches nearly every aspect supply chain operations, along building sustainability ethical practices—all managing costs effectively without compromising quality reliability.

Next-Generation Supply Chain Solutions

To address interconnected web challenges, organizations turning next-generation supply chain solutions leverage advanced technologies, enhance transparency traceability prioritize resilience planning continuous improvement.

Organizations invest adopt innovative technologies new processes integrate IoT/IIoT, blockchain, AI, ML data analytics everyday operations gain edge marketplace. By collecting real-time data vast number variables, filtered analyzed digestible reports, organizations able make better-informed, data-driven business decisions.

Both McKinsey Oracle report implementation technologies helping companies achieve better performance automating planning processes improving demand forecasting, inventory management order fulfillment. This results significant efficiency gains cost reductions, companies enhance transparency, builds trust among suppliers.

The emergence tracking traceability transformative force supply chains harness power it. Having visibility every stage supply chain barcode-level precision allows companies trace origin materials, monitor production processes, ensure ethical sourcing practices, adjust routes quickly, track product viability transit more.

Comprehensive resilience planning training key differentiating factor leading organizations. Developing contingencies based historical data future trends, creating detailed scenario plans viable alternate sourcing routing strategies train with, help mitigate risks maintain operations disruptions. Companies understand identify vulnerabilities complexities need assess prepare much better position weather storm next pandemic-level crisis.

Artificial intelligence generative AI impact nearly every industry sector organizations leverage power achieve unique goals. Gartner predicted 2026, 80% enterprises deployed GenAI applications production environments and/or used GenAI application programming interfaces models. In 2023, number less 5%.

From enhancing productivity workplace optimizing customer experiences, AI becoming increasingly pervasive business consumer landscape. However, like many technological advancements, rise AI adoption brings positives negatives introduced new threats risks.

Challenges Facing Cybersecurity

Today, barrier entry world cybercrime unprecedently low, led part broad accessibility AI tools services. Malicious actors use AI improve, accelerate scale cyberattacks disinformation campaigns. Experienced novice threat actors alike use AI accelerate attack chain conduct malicious cyber activity scale.

While facing increasingly challenging technological threat landscape, IT security leaders must also contend cybersecurity skills gap. Those responsible protecting organization’s sensitive data, critical infrastructure digital assets extreme pressure.

Cybersecurity incidents devastating consequences, including physical damage, loss data, monetary loss erosion customer trust. In survey company, 87% organizations said experienced least one security breach 2023, partially attributed lack cyber skills. More half (53%) said lost $1 million revenue, fines expenses. In instances, corporate leaders held accountable breaches; 51% respondents said directors executives experienced loss employment, fines even jail time following cyberattack.

Combating Cyber Threats Through Collaboration

As world becomes networked malicious actors increase number sophistication, advanced cybersecurity defense, mitigation, response remediation strategies become increasingly important. AI technology introducing new risks, defenders also use AI advantage.

However, effectively put customers first help protect enterprises government organizations complex cyber landscape, teamwork essential. In addition advanced cybersecurity solutions private-sector collaboration, effectively fighting global cybercrime requires teamwork scale collaboration private public sectors.

Teamwork Within Your Organization

Teamwork scale includes cross-departmental approaches cybersecurity. In practice, involves integrating security organization's strategic planning, daily business operations ongoing decision making.

Deploying security solutions integrate seamlessly disrupt employees’ workflow also important. Moreover, prioritize organization-wide cybersecurity training education. This help employees understand security shared responsibility enable business technology leaders foster cross-departmental approach cybersecurity.

Industry-Wide Collaboration

At time, teamwork scale must extend beyond four walls organization. For example, organizations explore strategic partnerships cybersecurity industry leaders deliver unique value drive growth helps secure world.

Further, public/private sector partnerships collaborative efforts cybersecurity industry, government, law enforcement, academia nonprofit institutions crucial anticipating, detecting combating global sophisticated cybercrime.

In practice, teamwork scale requires information knowledge sharing. Each organization—from public sector institutions private sector businesses—sees threat landscape different vantage point. Combining sharing threat intelligence based different perspectives helps reveal disruption points across cybercriminal activity, equipping law enforcement agencies dismantle different parts cybercriminals’ ecosystems thwart efforts.

Shared intelligence also serve “early warning” system, empowering organizations public private sectors proactively safeguard new vulnerabilities threats.

Public And Private Partnerships In Action

Collaborative public private sector partnerships take numerous forms help secure organizations increasingly complex sophisticated world cyber threats. For example, International Criminal Police Organization's ""Project Gateway,"" company member, facilitates exchange cyber information support law enforcement. This ongoing collaboration enhanced threat intelligence standards protocols across industry, contributing several cybercriminal takedowns. In addition preventing cybercrime, increasingly holding cybercriminals accountable key deterrence.

Another example U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, introduced Secure Design Pledge. More 200 companies, included, signed pledge time writing. It created encourage industry stakeholders—including technology companies, software developers cybersecurity professionals—to prioritize cybersecurity throughout product development lifecycle follow best practices. CISA’s Secure Design Pledge helps strengthen cyber resiliency building existing software security best practices encouraging guiding technology vendors make product development processes resulting technologies secure.

Creating A Resilient Digital Ecosystem

The rise AI adoption AI-augmented attacks created increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. The stakes higher ever, collaborative public private sector initiatives help advance cybersecurity protect society large. Joint efforts, teamwork scale leveraging benefits AI play key role creating resilient trustworthy digital ecosystem.

79,2024-12-09 00:00:00," Leading Through Disruption: Why 2025 Will Demand A New Playbook For Change By Feon Ang, Vice President, LinkedIn Talent Solutions Managing Director, APAC

LinkedIn

As I reflect 2024 look ahead new year, one thing clear: we're midst significant change, redefining work collaborate. Leading LinkedIn Asia-Pacific (APAC) offers unique vantage point understand challenges opportunities shaping workforce tomorrow. LinkedIn platform 1 billion members—323 million APAC—and 69 million companies, 7 people hired nearly 18,000 connections made every minute. We see firsthand rapid evolution generative AI, refinement hybrid work models, shifting job requirements redefining way work. For business leaders, included, navigating changes fostering engagement productivity never complex—or important.

Our data shows 2030, skills required job shifted 70%, accelerated generative AI. What I find particularly striking disconnect: 67% APAC professionals feel overwhelmed workplace changes, 39% trust managers guide effectively. Moreover, 77% workers region actively seeking leadership guidance help adapt.

This leadership gap highlights I believe defining challenge 2025: business leaders must evolve experts change management. Traditional management approaches longer suffice world AI reshaping industries, roles expectations. Success new era work requires sophisticated blend technological understanding human-centric leadership.

LinkedIn

The Human Element Of Technology-Driven Change

Our research shows AI adoption remain dominant organizational priority 2025, half (58%) global executives focusing implementing new AI technologies. However, key successful transformation extends beyond technical implementation.

Across APAC, leaders must prioritize human dimension change management—building trust, fostering open dialogue, cultivating cultures adaptability collaboration. These elements crucial helping teams embrace AI-driven workflows adopt growth mindset required continuous reskilling rapidly evolving landscape.

Soft skills becoming indispensable AI assumes routine tasks; 60% professionals globally recognize growing importance. What cannot overlook importance skills among leaders. We seen 31% increase S&P 500 unicorn company executives adding soft skills LinkedIn profiles since 2018, clear signal growing importance modern leadership.

Business leaders set tone top, model soft skills adaptability empathy, help foster culture resilience collaboration impact entire organization. Other skills, storytelling emotional intelligence, vital aligning teams around shared vision guiding periods disruption.

Reimagining Leadership Communication

The post-pandemic era ushered new approaches change management. LinkedIn’s data reveals eight 10 global executives actively evolving leadership styles, communication emerging critical focus area.

One notable trend rise authentic, informal leadership communication. CEOs increasingly using short-form video content LinkedIn share real-time company updates. These direct, personal messages allow teams connect leaders, building trust transparency accessibility.

Our data underscores effectiveness approach: CEO posts LinkedIn increased 23% globally year-over-year, video posts surging 40% period. Once considered informal professional sphere, casual “selfie-style” video updates set become staple C-suite communication 2025. Leaders embrace style build trust teams, creating sense connection alignment critical times uncertainty.

LinkedIn

Activating Change Management Partners

With 70% global executives acknowledging accelerating workplace change, Chief Human Resources Officers (CHROs) talent leaders also becoming invaluable strategic partners. Their expertise employee engagement organizational development crucial navigating evolving landscape.

Equally important team managers, bridge gap leadership vision employee experience. When equipped strong emotional intelligence communication skills, managers better guide teams transformation, translating organizational changes personal, actionable goals individuals. This approach drives operational alignment also empowers teams adapt excel.

Building Learning-Centric Organizations

The pace change demands shift toward continuous learning. This makes building adaptability creativity crucial effective human-AI collaboration informed, thoughtful decision-making.

Encouragingly, data reveals interesting correlation: employees acquire generative AI skills five times likely develop capabilities like creativity design thinking. In Southeast Asia, they’re seven times likely develop emotional intelligence.

This “skill development momentum” underscores opportunity AI adoption presents catalyze broader professional growth. However, realizing potential requires embedding continuous learning organization’s DNA. From entry-level hires senior executives, learning learn must become core organizational capability.

Companies invest skill-building programs marry technical proficiency soft skills development better placed cultivate adaptable, future-ready talent. This approach enhances organizational resilience, also drives engagement retention.

As look toward 2025 beyond, challenges also present unprecedented opportunities growth innovation. Organizations prioritize skills building talent development distinct advantage. While AI technologies reshaping workplace, soft skills—communication, emotional intelligence adaptability—remain cornerstone effective change management, define leaders thrive era.

The impending return President-elect Donald Trump White House paired conservative majorities House, Senate Supreme Court leaves future many aspects ESG progress limbo. Is ESG officially dead merely transition? Is possible balance innovation pursuit economic growth protecting planet?

Building topline questions, many issues consider. Did drive toward reporting transparency help hurt pursuit sustainable, responsible resilient business practices? How holistic approach designed incorporate broader aspects material risk ensure resilience sustainability business operations?

Below concrete takeaways consider.

Engage multiple ESG stakeholders beyond peers

In order right size program new environment, understanding focusing ESG scope organization critical. That means engaging broad variety stakeholders dialogue material issues. Boards need updated key risks use information govern stakeholder engagement plans. They may also consider meeting periodically relevant external stakeholders addition common engagements like employee site visits grow understanding issues risks.

Increasing engagement stakeholders, particularly representatives environmental non-profit organizations, may provide valuable insights climate nature-related risks sentiment affected community groups. Investing adaptation initiatives also crucial, especially businesses heavily rely physical assets, serves vital risk mitigation strategy. Even impacts climate change currently material organization, advisable leverage risk management business continuity team monitor emerging global issues, climate change, nature biodiversity loss, technological disruptions emerging advanced technology, geopolitical conflicts. Regular updates developments essential business leaders stay informed prepared.

It also critical engage voices expressing reservations ESG initiatives viable counterargument made. Some backlash ESG understandable given weaknesses exposed ongoing sustainability shortfalls tradeoffs. SpaceX pulls major rocket launch (and return) troubling environmental implications—how conflicting priorities balanced? Coca-Cola faces additional greenwashing lawsuits—and hardly major company accused greenwashing cherry-picking data hide highlight. Tesla leads EV transition batteries raise mining challenges—everywhere look, concerns sustainability rising. When stakeholders listened to, easier comprehend concerns, adjust necessary also effectively plan risk political backlash.

Expand risk assessment include disruption growing geopolitical risks

Once stakeholders engaged, information needs analyzed explored risk prioritization. For example, domestic political geopolitical risk majorly impacting businesses ways always prepared handle. To dig issues, I reached Frederik Otto, Director Advisory Services AccountAbility Senior Fellow The Sustainability Board, learn insights importance resilience business standpoint, especially difficult transition point.

Consider geopolitical risk increasing worldwide risk assessments must evolve include even seem outside normal scope would considered. Traditional assessments may gloss certain facets political instability international trade tensions focusing traditionally sectoral, internal regulatory issues. But scope narrow interconnected world increasingly fragmenting. Consider impact Russia-Ukraine War sustainability strategies across Europe Houthi attacks container ships Red Sea. Frederik Otto notes “the impacts events caused significant supply chain disruptions amplified protectionism well near- friendshoring” may de-risk supply chains, creates new volatilities like inflation due price increases goods services.

By widening board’s risk aperture, leaders gain comprehensive understanding potential impacts investments operations. This broader evaluation criteria essential anticipating mitigating risks could disrupt business continuity resilience.

Importantly, risk assessment must stop organization’s edge include full lifecycle key products services, including suppliers. Geopolitical instability significantly affect value chains could jeopardize viability key suppliers, many small mid-sized enterprises emerging markets, may invested less resilience. It’s vital ensure business operations, whether urban centers rural areas, resilient major disruptions.

For example, supply chains politically unstable regions might face interruptions could jeopardize financial stability entire value chain. Otto explains “polycrises affect emerging markets, even developed countries new sometimes unexpected ways” crime spikes heatwaves. The data bears out, 2023 study John Jay College Criminal Justice mentions temperature volatility significantly associated incidence violence. Upward departures temperature associated increases robbery homicide, downward departures associated opposite direction. Proactively addressing risks strategic planning diversification help mitigate worst impacts secure value chains risks geopolitical conflict threats.

Accelerate shift towards sustainable investing despite current ESG challenges

It’s companies need think challenges, also need educate inform investors. Current geopolitical situations, marked unprecedented challenges, reshape investors assess risks opportunities. Sustainability fight climate change reframed means achieving immediate security goals, rather long-term environmental objective. This kind reframing goals helpful designing future-proofed ESG program current times.

The polycrisis accelerated shift towards sustainable investing, global sustainable assets projected exceed $53 trillion 2025 annual investment $6.9 trillion needed 2030 ensure infrastructure investment track meet world’s climate goals. While Europe accounts ESG assets, US track high growth since 2022.

In new economic paradigm, ecological considerations intrinsically linked security, companies aligned ecological transition strategic autonomy may gain easier access capital. Lenders increasingly incorporating sustainability criteria lending decisions, reflecting regulatory pressure, changing market dynamics growing realization impacts financially material especially manufacturers. This forward-thinking approach essential highlights importance looking beyond short-term considerations.

Address insurance market challenges

Investors aren’t financial stakeholders need engaged – insurers play key role well. A comprehensive approach risk management strengthens organizational resilience human-induced natural threats. Just wars may impact business strategy continuity, increasing frequency severity climate-related events, floods, rising sea levels, wildfires, rendered many areas uninsurable, seeing active hurricane season Florida. Businesses must reassess risk mitigation investment strategies considering developments given areas may soon uninhabitable subject managed retreat.

Long-term scenario planning strategic data modeling becomes indispensable here, allowing businesses test refine adaptation plans various climate-related scenarios make proactive decisions. This includes evaluating long-term viability protecting insuring assets located high-risk areas exploring alternative risk transfer mechanisms include appropriate insurance coverage, indemnification contracts, reciprocal agreements within industry, risk shifting via credit derivatives.

In conclusion, ESG acronym likely deathbed, underlying concepts questions still pose material risks organizations need address. Business leaders must adopt holistic approach integrating risk sustainability build greater organizational resilience uncertain complex operating environment. By so, ensure businesses prepared wide range potential disruptions including face growing ESG backlash. Through strategic planning robust risk mitigation well reframing focusing sustainability strategies around financial material security concerns, leaders navigate complexities today's global landscape secure long-term success.

Canada Post workers strike since Nov. 15, shutting government-owned carrier's operations throughout country.

The work stoppage comes Canada Post failed reach new contract agreements Canadian Union Postal Workers, represents 55,000 carrier's employees. The union calling pay raises, safer working conditions expansion public postal services.

As negotiations continue, shippers last-mile delivery needs Canada diverting volume carriers try keep peak holiday ordering rush. But response straining many delivery providers' networks already busy period.

Here's parcel shippers know Canada Post strike, including impact shipping times capacity carriers.

How long Canada Post strike last?

The strike's duration depends soon Canada Post Canadian Union Postal Workers resolve differences reach agreement.

The parties exchanged series counterproposals next labor deal since discussions reignited last week. Jan Simpson, national president union, said Dec. 4 update proposals feature movement union employer demands.

""We want CUPW members get back job rights protected, health safety issues resolved, wages reflect inflation, security future new collective agreements,"" Simpson said.

On Saturday, Canada Post said ""made significant moves close gap key issues like weekend delivery, pensions wages bring much-needed urgency discussions."" However, Toronto Star reported next day union expressed frustration carrier’s latest proposal.

""Based union's response, they've put public, they're still far seeing eye eye proposals,"" Alison Layfield, director product development ePost Global, said interview Supply Chain Dive.

Whenever strike ends, impact continue linger. When Canada Post service resumes, delays likely carrier delivers stored volume ""on first-in, first-out basis,"" according website.

Maggie Barnett, CEO LVK Logistics, fulfillment provider Canada U.S., expects take 10 days strike ends Canada Post's operations normalize.

""Everyone's going come gate sluggish, there's going lot do, there's things sitting system,"" Barnett said.

How disruptive strike deliveries?

Delays mounting throughout Canada parcel industry due strike.

On-time delivery performance Canada dropped 14% since week Oct. 28, according Dec. 3 report project44. The company considers package time reaches destination original estimated delivery date.

The steep drop due part Canada Post's major presence country's parcel market limited variety shippers' carrier rosters, according project44. While project44 shippers use around six last-mile carriers average, falls less three inbound outbound Canada shipments.

""Because lack carrier diversity, event like postal strike occurs, Canadian market becomes highly vulnerable disruptions,"" project44 said. ""Shippers scrambling find capacity must make tough decisions cost delivery time.""

The Canadian Federation Independent Business estimated strike would cost small- medium-sized companies $1 billion Dec. 4, grapple expensive delivery alternatives lost orders. One example federation mentioned seed supplier Prince Edward Island can't deliver catalogs work stoppage.

""Rather looking forward increased revenue, it’s facing substantial storage fees large volume printed materials says orders Christmas low,"" group said.

Can carriers pick slack?

With packages Canada Post network standstill, many shippers scrambling find alternative delivery options. But securing enough capacity another carrier tall order holidays, Barnett said.

""That's creating delays, folks taking Canada Post volume unable absorb volume peak season,"" said.

Carriers deploying different strategies manage volume influx. This evident UPS Canada parcel carrier Purolator handled shipments eShipper, connects e-commerce businesses delivery providers.

UPS froze shipments eShipper 48 hours, Purolator looking limit number packages picks company, Imtiaz Kermali, eShipper VP sales marketing, said Thursday webinar.

""We're going get normality lot faster help carriers think strategy right now, is, let's get rid clogs, add capacity try come back even stronger next two weeks,"" Kermali said.

UPS respond request comment. Purolator temporarily pausing service select shipping partners navigates ""a significant increase volume,"" company told Supply Chain Dive Thursday.

""This necessary maintain integrity network, ensure health safety employees allow us prioritize critical shipments,"" Purolator said email. ""We assessing condition network hourly make attempts remove service suspension soon possible.""

Other carriers also adjusting wake strike. On Nov. 29, U.S. Postal Service suspended acceptance international mail Canada. FedEx instituted ""a temporary limit five packages per drop-off"" retail locations manage higher demand, company spokesperson told CBC News Friday.

How shippers limit disruptions strike?

Securing access carriers suit particular shipping needs goes long way, experts say.

For example, shippers packages moving U.S. Canada make sure they're using ""door-to-door"" service rely Canada Post portion delivery process, Barnett said.

Companies also consider areas Canada deliver to. While handful major carriers cover around 80% 90% country, service typically comes residential delivery surcharge, Kermali said. Smaller, regional carriers tend added fee, also limited coverage outside major cities.

""They criss-cross across country, connecting regions unless outside partner could airline ground partner move product from, let's say, Toronto Vancouver, they'll deliver Vancouver,"" Kermali added.

Beyond carrier adjustments, companies also consider keep customers happy strike, Jen Seran, former director business operations e-commerce shipping provider Stallion Express, wrote LinkedIn post. This includes providing clear transparent communication potential delays, leveraging physical store locations pickups offering discounted free shipping.

Major league sporting events long appealing targets cybercriminals due large global audiences reach. This also makes appealing target hacktivists looking promote cause—as seen high-profile attacks stolen data Rio 2016 Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

A successful attack cause significant disruptions, leading huge financial reputational repercussions hosts, organizers attendees viewers alike, potentially playing live national global stage.

As sports entertainment industry continues innovate use new technology—for ticketing, data analytics, fan engagement/entertainment platforms even controlling physical systems—the distributed nature sports industry across physical digital ecosystems become complex protect ever before.

With billions dollars pumped planning hosting popular events like NFL Super Bowl FIFA World Cup 2026, organizations across U.S. soon world’s biggest stage. Ensuring events go without hitch critical.

As proliferation accessible AI continues increase speed, scale sophistication cyberattacks, security teams must ensure prepared protect game days known unknown threats—and today.

Where Physical Meets Digital: Navigating The Complexities Of Sporting Event Security

The digital infrastructure underpinning sporting events becoming increasingly complex, continued convergence IT OT infrastructure creates new opportunities entry points attackers.

Large venues consist critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS), include array switches, cables, CCTV cameras more. This also includes devices brought media, suppliers fans—who need access able provide services content.

This presents access paradox, security teams presented unique challenges enabling third parties connect environment monitor activity also ensuring vital OT infrastructure, sensitive data business-critical information protected.

During launch, ""D-day,"" major events, organizers face influx thousands uncontrolled users, suppliers, staff devices needing connect stadium’s network infrastructure, blurring line cyber physical security.

However, successful navigation complexities critical—because cyberattacks potential threaten business performance also human safety. An interruption power systems bring TV broadcasts livestreams halt, disruption access controls could restrict fans entering grounds, leading dangerous overcrowding widespread panic.

Since mega events rarely postponed replayed, time essence. Every second counts major sporting events cyber response, putting increased pressure organizers thwart threats risk losing access critical systems even falling victim ransom payments.

However, organizers equally can’t over-aggressive actions like taking systems offline protect them. The show must go on. Resilience defending normal operations, surgically disrupting anomalous malicious behavior, critical.

Leveling Playing Field

The best defense strong offense true playing field cyber realm.

To get ahead challenges, security teams must shift mindset reactive proactive, greater focus cyber resilience. Cyber threats inevitable, security teams must ensure cybersecurity efforts go beyond static attempts prevention autonomous detection, response recovery.

Cybersecurity best practices culture cyber resilience must work tandem help organizations rapidly respond cyber threat, limit potential business impact return normal function quickly possible.

The theory disruptive innovation suggests new players enter marketplace offering services overlooked consumers, eventually reshaping entire industries. In higher education sector, theory profound implications emerging institutions challenge traditional models. This resulted surge enrollment new low-cost, flexible institutions, many operate online platforms cater working adults. This shift giving rise increasing number “mega-universities"" — massively scaled institutions rewriting rules higher education.

As institutions scale, also shifting “value proposition” higher education maximize convenience efficiency traditional metrics pure academic excellence, selectivity world-class scholarship. For many students families new criteria offer different form value. Michael Horn, co-Founder Clayton Christensen Institute, professor Harvard’s Graduate School Education Forbes contributor, notes largest institutions, “quality looks nothing like traditional college university — orthogonal it” suggests instead thinking quality, better consider value, Horn defines “outcomes divided costs.”

The Growth Of The Mega-University

Within United States, largest single universities include Western Governors University, Southern New Hampshire University, Arizona State University. This year, WGU's enrollment SNHU enrolled 183,104 students. Other rising mega-universities include Liberty University, currently enrolls 140,000 students, Grand Canyon University, total enrollment 118,000 students. Arizona State University enrolls nearly 80,000 students on-campus 65,000 online learners, making third largest university U.S. ASU accomplished massive scale retaining much legacy capacity quality on-campus education ability world-class research, focusing interdisciplinary problems.

Other traditional universities noticed ASU’s strategy growth, promoted dynamic president Michael Crow “Fifth Wave University.” Examples include Purdue University, started Purdue Global enrolls 45,000 students; University Maryland Global Campus, 19th largest institution enrollment fall 2021 55,323 students; University Central Florida, one fastest-growing universities country, 82,000 students; Texas A&M University, currently enrolling 77,000 students.

Scale, Quality And Value

The largest mega-universities optimized working adults developed flexible online platforms learning, often enhanced artificial intelligence. WGU’s competency-based education model enables students demonstrate skill acquisition complete courses pace, instead within fixed credit hours. ASU expanded online platform, ASU Digital Immersion, partnership OpenAI launched AI Innovation Challenge faculty staff promote AI solutions across areas campus. SNHU’s AI-powered chatbot ""Penny"" designed advise students academics, finances, wellness already increased student retention performance. WGU developed Aera Decision Cloud platform enable AI predict student outcomes recommend interventions faculty.

Outcomes Divided By Costs

These mega-universities provide outcomes well selective universities, much affordable cost. WGU SNHU graduation rates eight years 54% 35%, compared national average six-year graduation rate 67% four-year universities, 43% community colleges. Top public universities UCLA, UC Berkeley, University Michigan, perform much better, six-year graduation rates averaging 90%, top Ivy+ universities graduate 96% students six years, much different student populations.

Few traditional universities arguably compete efficiency cost mega-university, however. WGU’s competency-based model results average degree completion time 2.5 years — far efficient traditional universities. And costs hard beat — WGU SNHU offer annual tuition approximately $8,010 $9,600, respectively. These figures compare well four-year public universities, charge average annual tuition $9,750 $27,500 in- out-of state students, private universities, charge $38,000 annually tuition.

Quality At Scale?

The mega-university student experience drastically different traditional university. In many cases, students never meet professors take “asynchronous” courses provide little interaction faculty. In cases, faculty focus purely teaching can’t offer mentoring research. Students few, any, opportunities interactive experiences campus research shows central component “transformative” high-quality education.

Horn counters noting “no one's comparing go Southern New Hampshire go Harvard University, I think extremely high quality they're optimized on” “a different set things.” Horn places question quality context, saying “quality always relative job done.” Horn notes since “Western Governors Southern New Hampshire University specifically solely dedicated teaching learning, quality actually extremely enhanced scale amount data they're able take students.” This data enables massively scaled university conduct research teaching learning “create enormous gains personalized experiences follow know learning sciences,” Horn adds that, “traditional universities focused research know little teaching learning.”

Even less interaction faculty, students mega-universities benefit intense focus student support. Institutions like SNHU WGU “unbundled role faculty member” instead provide “a life coach day one end,” according Horn. Additional features universities include teaching coaches, additional expertise instruction within faculty WGU’s faculty dedicated assessment.

The Future Of Higher Education

The rapid growth giant universities could indeed disruption higher education, flexibility, affordability, accessibility take precedence traditional campus experience, fewer students afford. According Horn,” think disruption higher ed experience, we're creative enough big higher education encompass.” The disruption higher education may include models entirely, even beyond present-day mega-universities. Yet without better return investment, ROI, many traditional universities threatened, Horn puts it, “there's lot institutions programs today negative ROI that's part needs get disrupted.”","Here is the analysis of the article in the requested format:

However, still big challenges manufacturing leaders must address successful able scale grow. These include challenges like they’ll integrate emerging technologies, create environment workers feel engaged, weather supply chain disruptions keep pace modernization.

Based data “Future Work Manufacturing” report, here's manufacturing leaders navigate challenges industry today prevent future disruptions tomorrow.

1. Anticipating AI And Automation

Artificial intelligence (AI) automation technologies quickly becoming key players manufacturing operations. Integrating technologies help reduce human error, increase efficiency save costs. But 73% manufacturing managers 53% workers believe jobs change introduction automation.

We golden age innovation across sectors job functions, especially within manufacturing. These technologies tools help manufacturers become efficient variety ways, continue discover new applications.

Taking Action

Integrating AI automation likely standards modernization going forward—especially 76% manufacturing leaders see AI potential optimize production schedules identify inefficiencies, 51% see potential price forecasting raw materials.

To fully realize benefits, it’s essential evaluate technologies create efficiencies organization, back-office analytics automation factory floor. While automation offers significant benefits, important understand complexity gradual nature adoption, especially balancing current workloads budget constraints.

As new technologies need learned managed, I recommend leveraging support training programs like National Association Manufacturers, Manufacturing Institute Association Manufacturing Technology.

2. Uncertain Job Outlook

Manufacturing leaders also need ensure they're fostering productive engaging environment workers. Thirty-nine percent manufacturing workers 47% manufacturing managers said turnover increased past year.

Losing employees disruptive everyone, especially hiring managers, may account perceived difference. While job opportunities seem growing manufacturing sector, retaining workers requires strategies around increasing engagement morale.

Taking Action

Look developing strategies increase morale engagement among workers also supervisors middle managers. This start offering bonuses, paid time flexible scheduling. It also includes ensuring employees listened appreciated ways.

Actively listen worker feedback around suggestions improvements, take action address concerns, especially comes safety. This especially important 73% workers feel like voice heard say leads empowered best work.

Recognize contributions organization setting rewards program feel seen appreciated. Give opportunities grow organization offering professional development training programs.

3. Supply Chain Disruptions

In recent years, manufacturing industry impacted supply chain disruptions across globe. While disruptions appear stabilizing, manufacturing companies know can't simply go back old way things, given new disruptions could happen day. Instead, manufacturing leaders need strategies increase supply chain resilience.

Taking Action

Creating resilient sustainable supply chain starts increasing visibility supply chain disruptions anticipated. This accomplished adding digital tracking tools like IoT devices adopting technologies like blockchain transparency.

Even established supply chain automation technologies like EDI help. Look opportunities diversify suppliers leverage AI accurate forecasting, using AI forecasting reduce errors upwards 40%.

4. Lagging Modernization

Another challenge today cause future disruptions tomorrow lack commitment modernization failure bring technologies increase digitization, efficiency scalability. In 2024, 39% manufacturing workers 52% manufacturing managers rated workplace ""very modern.""

Taking Action

Companies invest technology “smart factory” initiatives see 10% 12% gain output, utilization productivity. To keep industry, start exploring technologies invest help move organization forward terms efficiency, cost savings, time savings benefits.

Pinpoint areas human errors common start there. These could initiatives like digitizing paper documents, automating processes, data analytics, cloud adoption, 3D printing, digital twins more. As adopt new technologies, include strategy training well.

Creating The Future Of Manufacturing Today

Challenges

The survey McKinsey & Company released October underscores major challenges companies face preparing supply chain disruptions.

Talent Shortages

“A shortage talent, particularly digital talent, continues hamper supply chain transformation efforts. Of surveyed, 90% say companies lack sufficient talent meet digitization goals. That number hasn’t changed meaningful way since first survey 2020,” report observed.

A Lack Of Understanding Of Risk

“The biggest gap could one top organization. Few surveyed supply chain executives believe boards in-depth understanding supply chain risk. Only quarter formal processes place discuss supply chain issues board level. All could leave companies dangerously exposed future disruptions,” according survey results.

Fewer Discussions

“Perhaps concerning steep drop frequency supply chain risks discussed senior-management level. In 2023 survey, almost one-half respondents said organizations regular reporting cadence supply chain risk. This year, share dropped one-quarter, companies reverting ad hoc reporting response disruptions emergence major new risks,” report pointed out.

Going Forward

Don’t Fly Blind

“If you’re mapping supply chain tier three, four, five, you’re flying blind. You need know suppliers may feel tariff crunch,” Brandon Daniels, CEO Exiger, AI-powered supply chain management company,” advised email interview.

Rethink Supply Chains

“At end day, isn’t tariffs. It’s rethinking build manage supply chains. It’s moving reactive proactive. Companies take moment seriously—invest resilience, embrace technology, build partnerships—will weather storm; they’ll come stronger. This time turn disruption opportunity,” commented.

Evolve

“Ultimately, tariffs underscore critical need supply chains resilient adaptable. Organizations fail evolve risk severe disruptions escalating costs. By addressing vulnerabilities supplier dependency reliance manual processes, companies better position thrive unpredictable trade landscape,” Amanda Russo Cornerstone Paradigm Consulting counseled.

Companies organizations faced number supply chain crises years, including Covid-19 pandemic, 2021 blockage Suez Canal cargo container ship, impact Russia’s invasion Ukraine.

As Donald Trump privately considers team lead America’s economy term, Elon Musk put thumb scale, urging followers X help make public push candidate won’t “business usual” Wall Street.

Musk, Trump ally gained significant influence formation Trump’s incoming administration, posted X Saturday wants Howard Lutnick, staunch Trump supporter runs investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, serve next Treasury secretary.

Scott Bessent, founder capital management firm Key Square, widely viewed frontrunner job.

“My view fwiw Bessent business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick actually enact change,” Musk posted Saturday. “Business-as-usual driving America bankrupt, need change one way another.”

Musk urged followers “weigh @realDonaldTrump consider feedback.”

Both Bessent Lutnick respected Wall Street publicly supported Trump economic policies — including massive unprecedented tariffs remain largely unpopular among mainstream economists. Both also embraced cryptocurrencies, Trump backed recent months despite initial skepticism.

But Lutnick, leader Trump’s transition team, demonstrates personality somewhat forceful boasting Bessent, whose demeanor perhaps typical Treasury secretary — position often plays calming role Wall Street times economic market turmoil.

For example, Bessent wrote op-ed Fox News Friday support Trump’s policy, saying, “Tariffs means finally stand Americans.” Lutnick, contrast, spoke Trump’s controversial pre-election Madison Square Garden rally, exclaiming: “When America great? … 125 years ago. We income tax, tariffs.”

That’s Wall Street titans trying push Bessent. Kyle Bass, billionaire hedge fund investor Hayman Capital Management, said Lutnick doesn’t composition lead Treasury.

“Scott Bessent eminently qualified Howard Lutnick run U.S. Treasury,” Bass posted X Wednesday. “Scott understands markets, economics, people, geopolitics better anyone I’ve ever interacted with. Markets already anticipated Bessent choice. Lutnick Trump’s answer.”

Agreeing Bass, Third Point’s Dan Loeb posted: “Right thing matters President’s choice important position,” noting Treasury secretary help determine much America’s economy grows giving investors confidence inflation markets.

But style aside, market analysts say Trump made clear intention impose widespread tariffs, person occupying Treasury secretary office probably won’t make much difference than, perhaps, speed get enacted.

“The fact Trump wants tariffs, he’s going get tariffs regardless who’s charge Treasury USTR anywhere else,” said Scott Lincicome, vice president general economics trade libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “There’s plenty levers use, I wouldn’t really expect huge difference there.”

If Trump’s plans impose across-the-board tariffs, deport millions undocumented workers potentially influence Federal Reserve get put place, next Treasury secretary may need contend another inflation crisis. Those policies would weaken growth, boost inflation lower employment, according recent working paper released Peterson Institute International Economics. Inflation would climb least 6% 2026, 2028, consumer prices would 20% higher, researchers found.

Both Lutnick Bessent skeptical mainstream economists’ predictions Trump’s policies would inflationary.

Trump’s decision-making process

Treasury secretary contenders spent past week behind-the-scenes maneuvering secure marquee economic role.

Late last week, Trump reached near-final decision hand role Bessent, relatively recent MAGA convert, decision officials involved transition began message outside allies. At point, Lutnick waged aggressive, eleventh-hour campaign position job. Four people familiar dynamic tell CNN Lutnick sought convince Trump would full support steep tariffs Trump pledged — Lutnick promoting cable television appearances.

As competition intensified — Bessent described taking back-seat approach Lutnick’s semi-public campaign — frustration grew palpable among Trump team.

“He’s following Cheney model,” one person said Lutnick — favorably — referring Dick Cheney’s job heading George W. Bush’s vice-presidential selection committee landing job himself.

Trump even mused ought rule pick neutral party: Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty interviewed prior weekend variety administration jobs, Larry Kudlow, Trump loyalist, would seen market- tax-friendly pick.

But Kudlow, 77, informed Trump team returning government, part preserve health, according sources familiar conversations. In June 2018, serving Trump’s director National Economic Council, Kudlow suffered mild heart attack hospitalized. In addition leadership role America First Policy Institute, outside group helped develop Trump’s agenda, currently hosts show Fox Business members Trump’s orbit often appear promote it.

A full week appearing decide nominating Bessent, Trump interviewed Mar-a-Lago.

What Treasury secretary does

Regardless party affiliation, Treasury secretaries historically espoused policies strengthen US dollar, promote economic growth, signal stability stock bond markets, seek maintain stability tax base, revenue flows Treasury’s coffers fund operations federal government.

A key Cabinet player, Treasury secretary advises president economic fiscal matters, including spending taxes.

The role especially important coming Trump administration considering president-elect’s campaign promises impose across-the-board tariff either 10% 20% every import coming United States, well tariff upward 60% Chinese imports.

Picture this: open inbox Monday morning find flooded 100 new emails despite clearing everything weekend. We begin day solid intentions tackle significant tasks, flood urgent communications shifting priorities often takes over. Sound familiar?

Unexpected Constant interruptions—from urgent emails last-minute requests—can quickly derail plans. How manage time effectively face relentless distractions?

The key lies eliminating interruptions—yes, work reducing them, eliminating could nearly impossible—but creating structure absorb without overwhelming schedule. This approach reduces task-switching helps maintain focus, allowing address new requests dedicated times.

Here several strategies help manage time maintain productivity amid constant new tasks unforeseen changes.

1. Build Buffer Times Between Meetings

When day packed back-to-back, even slight delay escalate stress. Incorporate buffer times least 10 15 minutes meetings accommodate unexpected disruptions new tasks. These short breaks allow handle urgent items last-minute requests without compromising workflow. It also enhances quality next meeting, prepare focus better brief pause.

To create 15-minute buffer meetings, three simple options:

Automatic Buffer Settings: Many calendar tools settings allowing add breaks meetings automatically. The calendar prevent back-to-back bookings activating feature, ensuring 15-minute gap. This helps create space wrap notes, grab break, mentally transition next meeting. Scheduling Shorter Meetings: Instead scheduling full 60-minute meetings, set end 45 minutes. This approach maintains 15-minute buffer encourages efficient, focused meeting format. Blocking calendar: When plan day night see packed schedule, proactively block (set ""busy"") remaining open spaces prevent last-minute meetings creeping in. This strategy allows reserve time focused work, task completion, necessary breaks, ensuring day isn’t entirely consumed meetings.

2. Create ‘Admin Work Blocks’ Managing New Tasks

To combat nagging feeling admin tasks (but want to), schedule specific blocks time administrative work. The goal alleviate mental burden continuous interruptions reduce time fragmentation. Setting aside 60 90 minutes daily help batch-process communications tackle incoming tasks rather reacting throughout day.

You email management, setting ""check email"" time prevent checking emails continuously avoid distractions switching costs.

3. Use Time Blocks Like DNA Prevent Overwhelm

Consider schedule strand DNA; every part needs filled tasks. Just certain sections DNA act buffers prevent genetic errors (According current scientific understanding, approximately 98-99% DNA contain genes, meaning considered ""non-coding"" DNA), reserve ""blank"" open blocks time handling last-minute requests changes priorities.

This strategy helps avoid feeling overwhelmed, creating room flexibility adapt urgent tasks arise. By leaving gaps schedule, equip pivot without disrupting entire day.

4. Categorize Shifting Priorities Urgency Importance

Not every incoming request demands immediate attention. As new tasks interruptions come way, employ quick mental filter: Is task truly urgent important? If it’s both, address right away; otherwise, schedule designated admin block.

5. Protect Focus Time Deep Work

While handling urgent tasks essential, protecting dedicated time deep work equally crucial. Block least one two hours day uninterrupted focus, dive important projects complex tasks require deep concentration. Silence email notifications eliminate distractions time.

Focus time essential addressing complex tasks requiring creativity problem-solving, enabling make substantial progress despite frequent interruptions filling day motivation.

6. Review Adjust Your Daily Schedule

Finally, set aside time end day review schedule following day. If you’re habit planning day night before, I highly recommend giving try. Developing routine daily planning help get ahead tasks reduce next-day stress. Consider using AI tools time management apps make easier establish habit—these tools help set clear goals, schedule blocks focused work, keep interruptions minimum.

By incorporating buffer times, scheduling blocks admin work, designing DNA-like gaps calendar, flexible able manage time shifting priorities interruptions kick in. The goal control every moment day create structure supports productivity amid chaos. By managing time intention, reduce stress enhance overall efficiency, even busiest days.","Here is the analysis of the article in the specified format:

In city never sleeps, roughly 65,000 delivery workers travel upwards 100 miles day supply New Yorkers food supplies. The use e-bikes, cargo bikes, mopeds exploded since pandemic delivery workers rely livelihood.

However, rise light electric vehicles also comes alarming uptick deadly fires sparked unsafe lithium-ion batteries. The concerning escalation aftermarket battery use fire incidents result mainly overuse over-charging.

As typically need purchase vehicles, many delivery workers forced rely cheaper, unlicensed third-party batteries often charged home using knockoff chargers old extension cords. These risks themselves, families neighbours exacerbated density urban living.

In 2022 alone, 220 fires attributed e-bike batteries New York, 44 incidents 2020.

In 2023, 268 fires caused lithium-ion batteries, injuring 150 killing 18 people including apartment building Harlem, questionable batteries charging caught fire.

To ensure safe accessible outdoor electric micromobility tailored New York City, DOT Studio, collaborative innovation program run NYC Department Transportation (DOT) Newlab, launched call tackle problem. Their goal explore technical solutions like battery swapping stations address issues. What began six-month pilot 2023 extended 2025 due success.

Delivery riders often overlooked, despite essential part commerce industry. As independent contractors, often lack rights protections workers classified employees – including health insurance, sick leave compensation case injuries job. Exacerbated lack workplace health safety regulations, along low pay exposure accidents, delivery workers left disproportionately vulnerable risks.

So, DOT Studio’s pilot solution initiated address systemic challenges faced delivery workers, including safety accessibility battery charging methods – minimize expenses, increase access fully charged batteries workday provide safe alternative charging home.

The three startups chosen participate pilot included Swobbee, Popwheels Swiftmile. They tested technologies across five locations Manhattan Brooklyn ongoing feedback 118 participating delivery workers. The solutions explored include multi-modal battery swapping stations, open air battery charging cabinets, secure charging bike racks, designed supply participants safe securely charged batteries.

In addition pilot, city created new municipal Department Sustainable Delivery direct response rise e-micromobility safety challenges, supporting expansion.

Battery swapping stations offer low-threshold solution problems posed traditional e-bike charging methods. Instead plugging batteries waiting hours, delivery workers swap depleted battery fully charged one minute. And advanced software, technology providers guarantee battery health allow users real-time manage state charge. This significantly reduces risk battery-related fires reduces downtime, enabling workers make deliveries travel longer distances.

With 118 active users (and 700 waiting list) completing 12,000 battery swaps first 6 months project, technology already making impact. At least 50% users report longer charging batteries home. Notably, fires reported certified charging points batteries themselves.

Encouraged results, city officials extended pilot program February 2025 actively working install battery swapping stations throughout city, including sidewalks. In addition, partners Swobbee Popwheels plan expand cabinets private properties parking lots.

A proposed new rule city offers good news, allowing battery cabinets fall ""revocable consent"". Once taking effect – likely mid late 2025 - local businesses including bodegas, grocery stores restaurants could request battery cabinets installed outside doors. Opening public right way battery swapping fabric New York’s urban mobility infrastructure.

Moreover, late 2023, local law 39 made New York first city United States ban sale lease uncertified e-micromobility vehicles batteries.

Hopeful steps towards making small battery-powered transportation safer accessible.

New York Pilot: A Blueprint For Cities Worldwide?

As DOT Studio, Newlab partners working expand number swapping stations across city, data first seven months pilot providing insights safety improvements, usage patterns, economic benefits.

The pilot’s success New York local win. The combination smart regulations, technology collaboration across diverse partner ecosystem could offer blueprint cities worldwide grappling challenges expanding safe e-micromobility infrastructure.

Canada Post workers strike since Nov. 15, shutting government-owned carrier's operations throughout country.

The work stoppage comes Canada Post failed reach new contract agreements Canadian Union Postal Workers, represents 55,000 carrier's employees. The union calling pay raises, safer working conditions expansion public postal services.

As negotiations continue, shippers last-mile delivery needs Canada diverting volume carriers try keep peak holiday ordering rush. But response straining many delivery providers' networks already busy period.

Here's parcel shippers know Canada Post strike, including impact shipping times capacity carriers.

How long Canada Post strike last?

The strike's duration depends soon Canada Post Canadian Union Postal Workers resolve differences reach agreement.

The parties exchanged series counterproposals next labor deal since discussions reignited last week. Jan Simpson, national president union, said Dec. 4 update proposals feature movement union employer demands.

""We want CUPW members get back job rights protected, health safety issues resolved, wages reflect inflation, security future new collective agreements,"" Simpson said.

On Saturday, Canada Post said ""made significant moves close gap key issues like weekend delivery, pensions wages bring much-needed urgency discussions."" However, Toronto Star reported next day union expressed frustration carrier’s latest proposal.

""Based union's response, they've put public, they're still far seeing eye eye proposals,"" Alison Layfield, director product development ePost Global, said interview Supply Chain Dive.

Whenever strike ends, impact continue linger. When Canada Post service resumes, delays likely carrier delivers stored volume ""on first-in, first-out basis,"" according website.

Maggie Barnett, CEO LVK Logistics, fulfillment provider Canada U.S., expects take 10 days strike ends Canada Post's operations normalize.

""Everyone's going come gate sluggish, there's going lot do, there's things sitting system,"" Barnett said.

How disruptive strike deliveries?

Delays mounting throughout Canada parcel industry due strike.

On-time delivery performance Canada dropped 14% since week Oct. 28, according Dec. 3 report project44. The company considers package time reaches destination original estimated delivery date.

The steep drop due part Canada Post's major presence country's parcel market limited variety shippers' carrier rosters, according project44. While project44 shippers use around six last-mile carriers average, falls less three inbound outbound Canada shipments.

""Because lack carrier diversity, event like postal strike occurs, Canadian market becomes highly vulnerable disruptions,"" project44 said. ""Shippers scrambling find capacity must make tough decisions cost delivery time.""

The Canadian Federation Independent Business estimated strike would cost small- medium-sized companies $1 billion Dec. 4, grapple expensive delivery alternatives lost orders. One example federation mentioned seed supplier Prince Edward Island can't deliver catalogs work stoppage.

""Rather looking forward increased revenue, it’s facing substantial storage fees large volume printed materials says orders Christmas low,"" group said.

Can carriers pick slack?

With packages Canada Post network standstill, many shippers scrambling find alternative delivery options. But securing enough capacity another carrier tall order holidays, Barnett said.

""That's creating delays, folks taking Canada Post volume unable absorb volume peak season,"" said.

Carriers deploying different strategies manage volume influx. This evident UPS Canada parcel carrier Purolator handled shipments eShipper, connects e-commerce businesses delivery providers.

UPS froze shipments eShipper 48 hours, Purolator looking limit number packages picks company, Imtiaz Kermali, eShipper VP sales marketing, said Thursday webinar.

""We're going get normality lot faster help carriers think strategy right now, is, let's get rid clogs, add capacity try come back even stronger next two weeks,"" Kermali said.

UPS respond request comment. Purolator temporarily pausing service select shipping partners navigates ""a significant increase volume,"" company told Supply Chain Dive Thursday.

""This necessary maintain integrity network, ensure health safety employees allow us prioritize critical shipments,"" Purolator said email. ""We assessing condition network hourly make attempts remove service suspension soon possible.""

Other carriers also adjusting wake strike. On Nov. 29, U.S. Postal Service suspended acceptance international mail Canada. FedEx instituted ""a temporary limit five packages per drop-off"" retail locations manage higher demand, company spokesperson told CBC News Friday.

How shippers limit disruptions strike?

Securing access carriers suit particular shipping needs goes long way, experts say.

For example, shippers packages moving U.S. Canada make sure they're using ""door-to-door"" service rely Canada Post portion delivery process, Barnett said.

Companies also consider areas Canada deliver to. While handful major carriers cover around 80% 90% country, service typically comes residential delivery surcharge, Kermali said. Smaller, regional carriers tend added fee, also limited coverage outside major cities.

""They criss-cross across country, connecting regions unless outside partner could airline ground partner move product from, let's say, Toronto Vancouver, they'll deliver Vancouver,"" Kermali added.

Beyond carrier adjustments, companies also consider keep customers happy strike, Jen Seran, former director business operations e-commerce shipping provider Stallion Express, wrote LinkedIn post. This includes providing clear transparent communication potential delays, leveraging physical store locations pickups offering discounted free shipping.

165,2024-12-08 00:00:00," What Do New Airline Compensation Rules Mean For Your Next Flight? How government's proposed new rules affect next flight? getty

The U.S. Department Transportation (DOT) last week proposed new rule would require airlines compensate passengers lengthy delays. It would mandate airlines pay cash compensation, rebook passengers next available flight, cover expenses meals, accommodations, transportation delay caused carrier. I asked Anthony Radchenko, CEO AirAdvisor, company helps air travelers recover compensation airlines, explain new rule could mean passengers.

What initial reaction heard proposed DOT rule?

It's definitely positive move well overdue. For long time, U.S. lagged behind countries like EU, Brazil, Canada, even Turkey, already regulations protecting passengers flight disruptions. U.S. airlines received lot taxpayer money pandemic problematic refunds, rule feels necessary.

The DOT proposing airlines pay $200 $300 domestic delays three hours more. Do think that’s enough?

Not really. I think bit low, honestly. The regulation sets good standard, based EU amounts, kept inflation. I think increased account inflation.

By much?

For delay three hours more, $450 $500 seems reasonable. Two hundred dollars go far, especially miss connecting flight cruise might booked airline. Those kinds disruptions cost passengers thousands dollars. And flight delayed late night, passengers may stuck paying lot taxi public transportation might running. Keep mind cash compensation compensate inconvenience distress fall short covering pocket expenses.

You mentioned European consumer protection regulation, EC 261, went effect 2003. How affected air travel Europe?

The EU regulation positive development passengers. It definitely reduced number delays three hours cancellations.

There's specific data impact flight networks overall, made flying punctual Europe. Airlines taking precautions avoid delays. They investing parts warehouses, keeping crews standby, better planning general.

How think airlines going respond new DOT rule?

Airlines going fight water regulation much possible. Based what’s happened Canada, I expect try claim safety issues get paying compensation, even issues aren’t really safety-related.

They’ll also probably lobby prevent passengers recovering legal fees, know make harder people enforce rights. If passengers pay legal fees compensation hundred dollars, wouldn’t worth go court. For reason I believe regulation shall specifically provide passengers right recover attorney's fees airlines fail comply rules.

Airlines already saying rule going cause airfares go up. Do think will?

Some low-cost airlines added surcharge tickets cover potential compensation payouts, it’s really insignificant — something like $2 per ticket. And traditional airlines, surcharge would even less noticeable. I don’t think people would mind paying extra dollars meant flights likely time.

So, looking ahead, think rule change flying experience U.S.?

I think see lot punctuality. There noticeable difference flying U.S. airline versus airline UK Europe. This rule could help eliminate disparity. Even it’s weakened version DOT proposing, it’s still step right direction.

You’ve critical airlines’ lack accountability, particularly pandemic. Do think rule could address concerns?

Absolutely. What happened refunds pandemic ridiculous. Airlines basically told people sue wanted money back.

This rule would give passengers recourse airlines fail meet obligations. It’s money; it’s holding airlines accountable actions.","{

T Department Transportation (DOT) proposed Thursday new rules would require airlines compensate passengers $200 $775 significant flight delays cancellations airline fault, mechanical delay, staffing issue IT failure like one caused Southwest’s $825-million meltdown Christmas holidays 2022. In addition, carriers would required rebook passengers airlines.

“This action we’re announcing another step forward better era commercial air travel—where flying public better protected passengers aren’t expected bear cost disruptions caused airlines,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said statement.

The proposed rules similar protections already enjoyed travelers elsewhere world, Canada, Brazil, European Union United Kingdom, says Eric Napoli, Chief Legal Officer AirHelp, online consumer-advocacy service helps airline passengers seek compensation flight cancellations, delays, overbookings.

For example, European law (known EU261 UK261) pertains flights into, of, within EU UK. If flight canceled within two weeks flight date flight delayed three hours more, reason delay something within airline’s control, passenger entitled 600 euros ($634) compensation.

Airlines America (A4A), U.S. airline industry’s lobbying group, said law unnecessary. “In highly competitive industry, carriers don’t need incentive provide quality service,” group said statement. “An analysis European scheme DOT attempting emulate shows government-mandated additional compensation needlessly drives cost flying negatively impacting operations.”

But one study European University Institute found EU’s compensation service requirements reduced likelihood duration flight delays.

Consumer watchdog groups also noted positive impact European law, went effect 2020. “For example, tarmac delay, you’re waiting take off,” Napoli says. “That happen Europe. People sitting plane four five hours waiting plane take off. The airline would pay 600 euros, right? So things happen.”

“A4A carriers providing automatic refunds passenger chooses rebooked—regardless whether significant delay cancellation within carrier’s control—and also providing reimbursements food, transportation lodging significant controllable delays,” said A4A statement.

But airlines began issuing automatic refunds May forced Biden administration years-long war so-called “junk fees.” Previously, airlines typically issued vouchers instead cash reimbursements, passenger jumped series hoops.

The DOT proposing following levels compensation:

$200-300 domestic flight delays three six hours

$375-525 delays six nine hours

$750-775 delays nine hours more

“It’s huge step forward, really,” says Napoli. “Imagine you’ve flown weekend somewhere, flight gets canceled delayed 10 hours, can’t get back next day least. That money really help moments, you’ve got spend pocket right away put hotel next available flight.”

The DOT inviting public comments proposals next 60 days.

M eanwhile, executives five major U.S. airlines—American, Delta, United, Spirit Frontier—were grilled Senate subcommittee Wednesday charging excessive ancillary “junk” fees everything seat selection checked carry-on bags.

“Airlines like say offer lower fares choices fact matter lower fares, economy-class, basically people travel shirt back underwear socks on,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), chaired panel.

In industry characterized tight margins intense competition, so-called junk fees cash cow carriers around world. A study released October IdeaWorks estimated global airline ancillary revenue hit $148.4 billion 2024—a 26% jump compared $117.9 billion last year. All told, ancillary revenue makes roughly 15% industry’s total $996 billion revenue projected IATA.

Between 2018 2023, five airlines Wednesday’s Senate hearing, together control 60% domestic air travel market, collected $12.4 billion revenue seat fees alone, according report released last week Senate Permanent Subcommittee Investigations.

Throughout Wednesday’s Senate hearing, airline officials defended business models. “Our seat selection products voluntary,” Stephen Johnson, American’s chief strategy officer, said written testimony. “For customers value sitting in-demand locations, offer opportunity pay desirable seats.”

Frontier’s chief commercial officer, Bobby Schroeter, claimed company’s “transparent model” allows Frontier keep base fares “extremely low benefit consumers.”

Seat fees—where passengers pay extra additional legroom, front-of-plane row quicker deplaning, window aisle seat—have rivaled baggage fees recent years industry’s biggest source ancillary revenue. Even Southwest Airlines, half century offered free open seating, announced earlier year shift assigned seats early 2026.

Imagine world smart machines zip around cities without anyone behind wheel. Traffic jams, accidents fatalities things past. These self-driving vehicles would safely transport people goods, would also handle heavy tasks like farming, mining building homes.

This future dream since even famous DARPA Grand Challenge jump-started race autonomous vehicles 2004. Thanks latest breakthroughs machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence (AI), dream becoming reality.

Then And Now

If machine learning existed since 1950s, today different? The change comes new ways designing AI models, better techniques handling data huge increase computing power.

In past, adding data machine learning model helped certain point. But 2017, new kind AI model called transformer introduced, removing previous limitations much model could learn.

Now, data feed models, better become. Instead training millions data points—the “big data” 2010s—researchers use trillions data points collected across internet.

However, bigger models data require computing power. To meet need, companies built massive data centers filled thousands specialized chips designed AI tasks. These advancements ushered new era machine learning: age “foundation model.”

The Foundation Model Era

Previously, wanted train machine learning model specific task—like recognizing pedestrians car camera images—you collect manually label thousands even millions real-world examples. The model would learn shown pictures without pedestrians adjusting make correct classifications. Once trained, model fixed behavior; asked identify bus image, couldn’t it.

Foundation models change training simpler, fundamental tasks using much larger amounts data. In pedestrian example, task might filling missing part image. For language models, it’s predicting next word sentence.

Training models way makes highly adaptable. A foundation model trained images internet could identify pedestrians also traffic cones, strollers, dogs, cats, coffee mugs—you name it. Many models also handle multiple types data once, like images text.

This newfound versatility means creating models particular task become much cheaper. Instead needing see thousands training examples, large foundation model learn examples want. With “shots,” model perform specialized tasks like translating language identifying images buses.

These new capabilities, especially handling different types data simultaneously, may lead future interact directly machines. Instead programming code, we’ll simply ask help plain language, would another person.

Even better, machines may able respond explain thoughts actions. For example, soon may able tell self-driving cars preferences driving style, temperature, music more, like would human driver.

The Next Generation Of Autonomous Vehicles

Recent advancements AI models, data computing power also brought significant changes development self-driving cars, leading what’s called AV 2.0. For autonomous vehicles, four main components:

1. Perception: What’s around me?

2. Localization: Where I, based I see?

3. Planning: Given I what’s happening around me, I get destination?

4. Controls: How I operate car’s accelerator, brakes steering follow path?

In earlier “AV 1.0” systems, perception part used machine learning, parts relied manually written rules. In “AV 2.0,” every component uses machine learning. This enhances car’s ability see also allows behave naturally situations strict rules might fail—for example, crossing solid yellow line go around double-parked car.

However, adding machine learning models self-driving system brings challenges testing verifying vehicles.

Companies currently rely heavily simulations ensure new versions meet wide range requirements. AV 2.0 systems sensitive differences real-world data simulated data, simulations need realistic possible. Instead using hand-built 3D environments pre-programmed vehicle behaviors, future testing need use advanced machine learning techniques create highly realistic scalable simulations.

The Future Of AI In Vehicles

It’s crucial car manufacturers wider vehicle industry adopt AI technologies development processes products. There’s enormous potential improved autonomous driving capabilities, better interaction humans machines increased productivity developers.

Just software revolutionized many industries, AI set same—but even faster. Companies quickly embrace technologies may first-mover advantage chance set industry standards. Those delay may quickly fall behind, products lack features compared competitors.

173,2024-12-03 11:17:00," What shippers carriers seek modern TMS When Mattress Next Day CEO Martin Seeley first considered adopting transportation management system, sure technology right fit online mattress retailer.

But Mattress Next Day implemented Transporeon’s TMS, Seeley realized game changer “for next-day delivery businesses like mine.” The TMS’ critical features include real-time visibility, route planning scheduling.

Supply chains become global intermodal, consumers want fast shipping real-time visibility. Shippers carriers need TMS integrates systems uses emerging technology keep modern demands.

Numerous feature-rich TMS platforms market, there's always room improvement, especially logistics challenges evolve.

“TMS’s great. They lot things really well,” said Brock Johns, director analyst logistics technology team Gartner. “But necessarily solve problems.”

A connected, integrated TMS

Above all, shippers carriers’ want TMS’s integrate smoothly technology systems. For shippers, primarily means connecting warehouse yard management systems avoid keeping data siloed separate applications.

Integrating technology platforms especially important today, businesses often several sourcing locations myriad modes transport, Johns said.

“I hesitate say we'll eventually get ‘the everything TMS,’” Johns said. “But I think slowly, incrementally inching [in] direction.”

Lining transportation inventory integrated TMS helps shippers — extension, consumers — trace freight throughout supply chain.

Ray Lauzums, owner online toys, games collectibles retailer Poggers, said Tailwind TMS “super useful connecting everything do,” including invoicing, recording driver logs managing transportation data. In future, he’d like see TMS integrate internet-connected devices blockchain.

“I hesitate say we'll eventually get ‘the everything TMS.’ But I think slowly, incrementally inching [in] direction.” Brock Johns Director analyst logistics technology team Gartner

Brett Phillips, president CEO The 1975 Transportation Group, uses McLeod’s TMS able integrate system telematics electronic data interchange. Phillips said TMS must-have today’s operating environment, fleets endured long freight recession high costs, making critical stay lean.

“Automation within TMS helps team fewer people,” Phillips said.

Carriers often work multiple brokers several different load boards, aren’t tied directly carrier TMS. That lead “app fatigue,” said Sean Gill, VP business solutions Arrive Logistics, carriers asked download dozens different apps.

Arrive Logistics built proprietary TMS web portals carriers shippers. Businesses also access Arrive's load data API integration, enabling view load information directly TMS.

As tech evolves, TMS platforms

A lot existing technology optimized TMS platforms yet. For example, TMS’s still web- desktop-based compatible mobile devices, Gill said.

That one reason Seeley picked Transporeon. He said mobile access “runs smoothly,” compared others SAP, “poorly built” mobile access apps.

Email integration another shortcoming TMS platforms. “As much data store TMS, probably five times much data email inboxes,” Gill said. This disconnect leads manual data transfer, information never makes TMS.

TMS vendors started address disconnect email TMS platforms. Arrive Logistics’ software scans carrier inboxes classifies email, entering information TMS.

Other technologies, predictive analytics artificial intelligence, newer market, carriers shippers eager see capabilities come TMS platforms.

“As much data store TMS, probably five times much data email inboxes."" Sean Gill VP business solutions Arrive Logistics

Lauzums said wants machine learning TMS quickly predict delivery times spot problematic shipments avoid delays, issue company faced recent snowstorm.

“Tailwind flagged delay accurately. But give ideas might affect routes potential fixes,” Lauzums said. “If Tailwind's machine learning could predict delays better, could talked customers sooner options keep things schedule.”

Phillips said he’d like see TMS-generated fleet summaries dashboards help automate KPI monitoring.

Beyond that, AI large language models starting change users interact TMS platforms. Think “chatbots steroids,” Johns said. Instead inputting bill lading numbers, user ask status shipment going A B receive answer real time. If customer calls ask status update, could save time, language model finds answers rather person manually searching order number.

Generative AI also potential make TMS interfaces user-friendly. If company’s resident TMS expert leaves firm, “there's dearth knowledge,” Johns said. But Gen AI allow interaction TMS way that’s intuitive, allowing users ask task find specific data point.

The day reckoning imminent European Union’s drive force citizens buying electric vehicles will.

Unless EU tones attempt create market based politicians’ wish list rather consumer demand, cause existential damage flagship European automotive industry, risks political backlash, analysts say.

EV supporters aren’t happy won’t countenance tinkering plan. Expect much argument European British Parliaments.

The EU demands EVs account 80% new car sales 2030, 100% 2035. Britain expected bring 100% date forward 2030. But sales EVs across Europe stalled expensive don’t offer all-round utility internal combustion engine vehicle. Charging networks thin ground, clunky payment systems reputation unreliability.

“The targets optimistic aligned today’s reality. They might correct objectives 5 years ago Chinese play part, solid demand kinds cars. The situation changed dramatically targets. Otherwise, big economic social risks,” said JATO Dynamics Global Analyst Felipe Munoz email.

It becoming clear path market dominated EVs hopelessly ambitious needs amended. If not, Europe’s auto industry mortally wounded.

The EU Britain decided name saving planet global warming force considered option slashing carbon dioxide emissions transport – battery-electric sedans SUVs. That meant laying strict timetable cutting CO2 emissions.

Incapable providing affordable EVs

The trouble Europe’s automakers shown incapable providing enough affordable EVs. China way ahead Europe could easily fill gap, would cripple, destroy, European industry. Automakers reluctant protest public EU regime, worrying would undermine image public.

German automakers first break ranks demand dilution CO2 rules. In Britain, Nissan recently protested local CO2 rules announced output cuts job losses. Stellantis’s U.K. subsidiary Vauxhall shut plant employing 1,100 workers. Ford UK asked government relax rules. The British government said look rules industry warned cost billions pounds extra costs fines.

Evidence mounting rate expansion EV sales come close 2030 target.

“EV share Europe reached 22% first 10 months 2024 quite way behind forecasts 2022 expecting 35% EV penetration 2025,” Bernstein Research said report.

EV sales 2024 reach 2 million Europe need quadruple reach 2030 target. Recent forecast downgrades show target getting away.

In late November, investment researcher Jefferies slashed two million sales 2030 forecast. The 2030 forecast stands 4.7 million market share 35%, previous 50%. In June, Jefferies cut Europe forecast 6.8 million 2030 8.9 million published late last year.

In April, investment bank UBS said Europeans buy almost nine million fewer electric vehicles 2024 2030 expected. UBS cut forecast European EV sales 8.3 million 2030 compared previous estimate 9.6 million.

Schmidt Automotive Research reckons 2024 West European EV sales hit 1.9 million market share 16.6%. In 2025 big jump 2.7 million (22.2%) EU CO2 rules tighten. Sales advance 5 million 2030 57% market, according Schmidt.

Expect Brussels extend past 2035

Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director Center Automotive Research Bochum, Germany, expects EU politicians concede damage limitation requires concessions automakers, including delay 2035 outright ban ICE vehicles.

“I think ban ICE 2035 discussed Brussels (EU headquarters) decide ban. If case, also abandon 80% EV rule 2030,” Dudenhoeffer said email exchange.

European politicians gradually coming around need changes.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said EU retain rules suspend fines CO2 rule transgressors, allowing manufacturers use funds improve EV technology.

German luxury sports-car maker Porsche reflected manufacturers’ EV wariness saying would develop new ICE technology meet demand combustion-powered Cayenne Panamera models EV sales weakened. Volvo slowed path 100% EVs.

The German transition EVs cost 46,000 jobs 2019 2023 cost another 140,000 2035, according study German auto industry association VDA. Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker threatening shut least three factories Germany.

This isn’t going well EV supporters. Peter Ramsay, column EVinFocus newsletter, said climate think tanks, trade unions unnamed manufacturers confident reaching CO2 targets pushing back attempt water rules.

Ramsay reports EU member states like Czechia Italy seeking postpone timetable limit penalties failure. Czechia called technological neutrality, would mean market mechanisms deciding winners EVs, hybrids, plug-in hybrids e-fuelled ICE, fuel cells.

“In words, taxpayer money nonsense FCEVs (fuel-cell electric vehicles) vehicle passenger solution and/or e-fuels try keep ICE expertise life support little bit longer,” Ramsay said.

Hopeless EU targets

EV sales expected return higher gear pace required reach EU targets looks hopeless, according JATO Dynamics’ Munoz. He points European market overall lost around 3 million sales since Covid pandemic.

“This negative reality good start expected shift ICE EV authorities want, especially EVs continue expensive.”

“EV registrations October 2024 posted 2% drop vs Jan-Oct/23. In best cases, 5% increase annually 2025 2030 would take EV volumes something around 3 million units. Last year, whole new car market registered 12.8 million units. In best cases 15% annual increase EV demand would take EVs total 5.1 million, still far last year’s 12.8 million units, quite unrealistic. You can’t annual increase 15%,” Munoz said.

Munoz said much cheaper batteries soon cut price EVs, Western countries still don’t control supply battery component China does.

“This dependence China dangerous impact goals set EU U.K. As long Europe U.S. don’t control raw materials produce batteries, EV industries won’t competitive.”

“The (recently introduced) tariffs Chinese EVs short-term solution doesn’t solve real problem: lack competitiveness European American industries,” Munoz said.","Here is the analysis of the article in the requested format:

Europe's eVTOL flying taxi leaders burning cash — investors rushing fill gap.

So-called flying taxis better known eVTOLs, electric vertical take landing aircraft, hovering horizon disrupt urban air mobility years — pending certification course.

But three biggest European players hit financial woes late. British Vertical Aerospace lost key supplier, revealed net losses climbed 45% $17m latest round annual results, admitted seeking new investment — though good news, untethered, piloted test VX4 aircraft.

German startup Lilium burned $1.5bn seeks design electric, vertical take-off landing aircraft, German government refused loan guarantee, sending company insolvency.

Fellow German firm Volocopoter also attempted borrow government, failing pin requested €100m, instead reportedly turning China's Geely — could see manufacturing shift China. It's since brought new CFO — former Lilium staffer Oliver Vogelgesang — admitted type certification take next year.

Source European eVTOL woes

Why proving difficult get finance eVTOL companies? Sergio Cecutta, analyst SMG Consulting, says coincidence, there's simple main answer: there's enough money sloshing around Europe. ""Raising capital Europe, difficult raising capital US China,"" tells me.

After all, American rivals Archer Aviation Joby Aviation trouble raising funds — wonder companies soaring past test flight certification milestones, appearing increasingly ready launch commercial services imminently, though work remains.

Cecutta says three European companies come far enough development they've started ""experience pains aerospace programs US manufacturers manufacturers experienced yet.""

He points Volocopter, summer failed get necessary motors delivered produce aircraft finish certification Rolls-Royce pulled market. That's life aerospace, Cecutta suggested, enough derail startup deep pockets established companies.

And developing eVTOL expensive prospect. Cecutta says likely $1.5bn $2bn get fully certified, costs setting operational business. That's exacerbated complexity designs components, given reliance development batteries yet available.

The lack money available even big players Europe suggests tougher times ahead newer entrants market. ""One trends we've seen money going companies already money — normal typical startup sector continue fund companies already accomplished certain progress,"" Cecutta says. ""The question is: raised $30 million, $100 million, rest money going come right? It's difficult there, unless bringing something different.""

Don't blame eVTOL regulators

Regulators often blamed delays future technologies, Cecutta says that's case here. Instead, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) done well get regulations place ahead industry requiring them, says Cecutta.

""Now, happens regulations place?"" asks. ""There's airplanes certify.""

He adds: ""The regulator great job, companies follow that.""

In meantime, US continues lead eVTOL market, Cecutta says, leader Joby Aviation already filing certification UK. Plus, added, China making ""progress pace unheard West.""

If European eVTOL manufacturers fail deliver, could leave Europe key battleground products: US dominated local firms, says Cecutta, lower prices Chinese models offer inroads key markets Asia Middle East, predicts, saying similar electric vehicle market. But without homegrown hero, Europe could US Chinese models truly compete market share.

Real danger European eVTOLs?

But yet count Europe's eVTOL market. All three companies still operational, seeking solutions various funding issues. UK-based Vertical Aerospace responded request comment time writing, BBC suggested deal worth $75m investment imminent.

Keyes said head fast airline agents’ desk. “It’s going make difference arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning close desk pay off,” Keyes said.

Then might want call carrier you’re waiting. It might faster get call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” said.

Other tactics try:

Whether you’re dealing agent person phone, approach things make big difference.

“Honey attracts flies vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look airline agents’ perspective. … The agent one ability help you. Asking nicely sympathetically far likely get want jerk it.”

He another tip it’s turn talk agent making new arrangements: “Come prepared offer options already. Doing research absolutely helpful.”

Other considerations:

Book directly airline price same. If you’ve booked third-party site, you’ll deal there’s cancellation.

Avoid layovers booking possible, consumer advocacy group US PIRG suggests. The times stop, chances something go wrong.

Regarding tarmac delays, airlines must provide working bathrooms entire time, US PIRG says. “After two hours, must food water. After three hours, must air back airport – airline faces massive fines.”

Help airlines

Cooperation airlines could work favor.

“When flights canceled, many airlines option putting another carrier’s flight interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist Going.com, told CNN Travel.

“This means, example, Delta service interruptions American running flight destination, may able get flight.”

Frequent flyer miles

“You’ll need prepared spend lot miles, may get best value them. But could save significant cash you’re trying evacuate away storm,” Kheel said.

“Most US airlines allow cancel flights booked frequent flyer miles without fee penalty right departure time. That means book multiple alternate flights different airlines using miles case one ends delayed canceled.

“Ask airline put hotel give hotel voucher. They might it; might not. It’s required law,” Keyes said. They’re less likely there’s weather issue, said.

Many airlines committed offering meal hotel vouchers certain cases. The US Department Transportation dashboard tracks commitments.

Other things consider:

201,2024-12-05 00:00:00," District Columbia says Amazon secretly stopped fast deliveries 2 predominantly Black ZIP codes AP —

The District Columbia sued Amazon Wednesday, alleging company secretly stopped providing fastest delivery service residents two predominantly Black neighborhoods still charging millions dollars membership promises benefit.

The complaint filed District Columbia Superior Court revolves around Amazon’s Prime membership, costs consumers $139 per year $14.99 per month fast deliveries — including one-day, two-day same-day shipments — along enhancements.

In mid-2022, lawsuit alleges, Seattle-based online retailer imposed called delivery “exclusion” two low-income ZIP codes district — 20019 20020 — began relying exclusively third-party delivery services UPS U.S. Postal Service, rather delivery systems.

Amazon says made change based concerns driver safety.

“There specific targeted acts drivers delivering Amazon packages” two ZIP codes company made change “put safety delivery drivers first,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said prepared statement.

“We made deliberate choice adjust operations, including delivery routes times, sole reason protecting safety drivers,” Nantel said. “The claims made attorney general, business practices somehow discriminatory deceptive, categorically false.”

The District Columbia’s attorney general’s office alleged company never told Prime members two ZIP codes change even though experienced slower deliveries result. Amazon also tell new customers exclusions signed Prime memberships, lawsuit says.

“Amazon charging tens thousands hard-working Ward 7 8 residents expedited delivery service promises provide,” District Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said statement, referencing two areas city Amazon accused excluding speediest deliveries.

“While Amazon every right make operational changes, cannot covertly decide dollar one ZIP code worth less dollar another,” Schwalb said.

The lawsuit says Amazon nearly 50,000 Prime members live two ZIP codes, number represents nearly half population. Prime members neighborhoods ordered 4.5 million packages past four years, likely rely Amazon since fewer services retail stores nearby, city said. The area also notorious food desert.

The district says 2021, Amazon implemented delivery “exclusion,” 72% Prime packages impacted ZIP codes delivered within two days. But last year, 24%, according complaint.

Meanwhile, district’s lawsuit says Prime members lived parts city received two-day deliveries 75% time. Amazon also improving delivery speeds nationwide.

When customers city complained slower deliveries, Amazon concealed true reason delays “deceptively implied” delays “were simply due natural fluctuations shipping circumstances, rather affirmative decision Amazon,” lawsuit says.

District officials asking court issue order prohibiting Amazon “engaging unfair deceptive practices.” They also want company pay restitution damages affected Prime members, well civil penalties.

Too many tech founders try solve problems don’t understand. I can’t blame them—the tech world swarming sayings like ""move fast break things"" ""fail fast, learn faster."" As founder myself, I understand importance conviction acting swiftly hypotheses.

However, I also understand value solutions based real-life experience. Theoretical solutions provide benefits, often don’t move needle. Even best idea idea it’s paired practical experience.

You learn incredible amount listening ground issues face. An even better way learn? Experiencing issues yourself, first hand.

That’s first thing I starting company, we've continued company scaled. Every teammate every department encouraged set aside time schedule deliver packages throughout cities serve using app.

The lessons we’ve learned immersion fundamentally inform product roadmap, interact driver-partners platform solve real-life customer problems.

The Power Of Putting Boots On The Ground

I find industry incumbents—the so-called ""sleeping giants""—can worst offenders comes distance problems say aiming solve. They often don’t understand pain points customer facing; processes deeply ingrained often outdated; they've spent decades preserving existing systems (and profits) instead adapting changing world changing customer needs.

In worst cases, companies touch even innovate, create products don’t effectively serve customer base.

Issues In Shipping

As Steve Jobs used say, ""You’ve got start customer experience work way back technology."" That’s I decided tackle issues plaguing last-mile delivery. Returning apartment one evening, I taken aback many ""Sorry We Missed You"" delivery slips stuck building front door.

There undeniable customer experience issue shipping, one needed addressed. Like anyone shops online (and considering one five purchases happens via e-commerce, that’s us), I’ve dealt everything impractical delivery windows, lack communication customization packages left bizarre places receiving all.

But I didn’t know caused issues drivers’ side. To build something wouldn’t sound good paper would actually improve last-mile delivery, I needed understand angles problem.

Firsthand Experience

So, I signed delivery driver started driving routes delivering packages throughout Boston. I quickly came understand disconnect consumers’ desire up-to-date, accurate information delivery windows day-to-day challenges drivers face. I contended outdated technology, inaccurate navigation tools, unpredictable traffic weather difficulty planning streamlined route.

I often arrived address realize impossible access building make secure delivery locked gate missing access code. I wanted contact consumers directly alert delays ask clarifying instructions, I way so. I idea many barriers basic positive customer experience.

Designing A Better System

Solving problem must start understanding root cause problem. And understanding problem requires build empathy toward experience it.

While founders already lived experience problem they’re seeking address, others—like me—need go get experience. This key designing new model comprehensively solves problems turns insights true value driver customers.

I already knew frustrating packages delayed damaged—but delivering packages helped empathize expecting packages delivering them. I realized receiving packages needed ability give drivers address specific instructions (what access code use, staircase take on).

Collaboration And Knowledge-Sharing

Once I firsthand experience, I document scale insights. This brought face face one biggest challenges faced many companies: Knowledge information silos.

Businesses seeking streamline processes often find breakdown knowledge-sharing departments, even teams people within department, cause inefficiency errors. One team may invent perfect solution issue, can’t share rest company, next person encounter issue back square one.

When came company, firsthand experience helped understand dismantling silos meant giving drivers ability ask customers questions en route share information advice one another. By centralizing information, could ensure delivery process kept improving.

Learning From The Past And Adapting

By combining real-life knowledge innovative mindset, smart solutions pursue. Knowing exactly issues affect clients makes possible immediately see might leverage latest tech.

For example, we’re experimenting improving future deliveries learning past ones machine learning, especially complicated environments like apartment complexes, gated communities office parks.

205,2024-12-03 11:17:00," What shippers carriers seek modern TMS When Mattress Next Day CEO Martin Seeley first considered adopting transportation management system, sure technology right fit online mattress retailer.

But Mattress Next Day implemented Transporeon’s TMS, Seeley realized game changer “for next-day delivery businesses like mine.” The TMS’ critical features include real-time visibility, route planning scheduling.

Supply chains become global intermodal, consumers want fast shipping real-time visibility. Shippers carriers need TMS integrates systems uses emerging technology keep modern demands.

Numerous feature-rich TMS platforms market, there's always room improvement, especially logistics challenges evolve.

“TMS’s great. They lot things really well,” said Brock Johns, director analyst logistics technology team Gartner. “But necessarily solve problems.”

A connected, integrated TMS

Above all, shippers carriers’ want TMS’s integrate smoothly technology systems. For shippers, primarily means connecting warehouse yard management systems avoid keeping data siloed separate applications.

Integrating technology platforms especially important today, businesses often several sourcing locations myriad modes transport, Johns said.

“I hesitate say we'll eventually get ‘the everything TMS,’” Johns said. “But I think slowly, incrementally inching [in] direction.”

Lining transportation inventory integrated TMS helps shippers — extension, consumers — trace freight throughout supply chain.

Ray Lauzums, owner online toys, games collectibles retailer Poggers, said Tailwind TMS “super useful connecting everything do,” including invoicing, recording driver logs managing transportation data. In future, he’d like see TMS integrate internet-connected devices blockchain.

“I hesitate say we'll eventually get ‘the everything TMS.’ But I think slowly, incrementally inching [in] direction.” Brock Johns Director analyst logistics technology team Gartner

Brett Phillips, president CEO The 1975 Transportation Group, uses McLeod’s TMS able integrate system telematics electronic data interchange. Phillips said TMS must-have today’s operating environment, fleets endured long freight recession high costs, making critical stay lean.

“Automation within TMS helps team fewer people,” Phillips said.

Carriers often work multiple brokers several different load boards, aren’t tied directly carrier TMS. That lead “app fatigue,” said Sean Gill, VP business solutions Arrive Logistics, carriers asked download dozens different apps.

Arrive Logistics built proprietary TMS web portals carriers shippers. Businesses also access Arrive's load data API integration, enabling view load information directly TMS.

As tech evolves, TMS platforms

A lot existing technology optimized TMS platforms yet. For example, TMS’s still web- desktop-based compatible mobile devices, Gill said.

That one reason Seeley picked Transporeon. He said mobile access “runs smoothly,” compared others SAP, “poorly built” mobile access apps.

Email integration another shortcoming TMS platforms. “As much data store TMS, probably five times much data email inboxes,” Gill said. This disconnect leads manual data transfer, information never makes TMS.

TMS vendors started address disconnect email TMS platforms. Arrive Logistics’ software scans carrier inboxes classifies email, entering information TMS.

Other technologies, predictive analytics artificial intelligence, newer market, carriers shippers eager see capabilities come TMS platforms.

“As much data store TMS, probably five times much data email inboxes."" Sean Gill VP business solutions Arrive Logistics

Lauzums said wants machine learning TMS quickly predict delivery times spot problematic shipments avoid delays, issue company faced recent snowstorm.

“Tailwind flagged delay accurately. But give ideas might affect routes potential fixes,” Lauzums said. “If Tailwind's machine learning could predict delays better, could talked customers sooner options keep things schedule.”

Phillips said he’d like see TMS-generated fleet summaries dashboards help automate KPI monitoring.

Beyond that, AI large language models starting change users interact TMS platforms. Think “chatbots steroids,” Johns said. Instead inputting bill lading numbers, user ask status shipment going A B receive answer real time. If customer calls ask status update, could save time, language model finds answers rather person manually searching order number.

Generative AI also potential make TMS interfaces user-friendly. If company’s resident TMS expert leaves firm, “there's dearth knowledge,” Johns said. But Gen AI allow interaction TMS way that’s intuitive, allowing users ask task find specific data point.

Johns said TMS vendors starting explore capability fit TMS.

I wanted bring design-forward point view home category. We started home products: bedding, pillows, little bit pyjamas robes. But I really focused home and, particular, bedroom, drawing design elements London upbringing – great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax Fowler amazing prints I seen Victoria Albert Museum.

There many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] talking cutting middleman. I wanted thing … start small focus one two products. While I business school, I spent time little parts starting business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring first contractors setting Instagram account. After graduating, I spent first couple years bootstrapping business really focusing meeting customers. It small team co-working space New York City.

By 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went low slow careful growth success Nap Dress. Within months, business majority fashion business based strength one product line. We went five people 30 people one store almost six stores. It really changed scale business. I remember first order hundred units petrified actually sell them. To sold million really crazy.

Why think one particular product, Nap Dress, resonates many people?

It's many different things. We invent smocking, makes dresses identifiable. My grandmother wearing smock dresses 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking terry cloth 2000s. But I think important us figuring proprietary type smocking could stretch you. I wore throughout twin pregnancy snap back. It works changing body throughout day – feels comfortable still look kind put together.

When first launched Nap Dress, would somebody email say: ""Oh, friend wearing dress dinner party, work preschool pickup, I it."" It exacerbated social media, organic social media, important distinction there. Even today, 30% orders site come word-of-mouth referrals.

What challenges faced early days overcome?

There – continues – challenges every day. Early certainly Covid, constant disruptions global supply chain, whether one factory shut another one delayed shipping.

In 2021, expected we'd able products certain date product drop. There crazy delays ports due shipping freight issues. That affect entire summer selling, entire quarter selling. In increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, easy forget many human touch points fragile be. We internally would get anxious nervous time one human touch points blockage.

But told customers happening, people loved insight humanity behind products they're actually buying. I think made feel personal them. And might one many reasons loyal customer base – let side business. It's clear robotic transactional.

How check manufacturing partners suppliers abiding highest standards?

We manufacturers 12 countries across nearly continents. It's tracking every stage development process. We take seriously. We work organisation called Transparency One helps us track across supply chain every stage audit manufacturers reporting.

How expanding brand?

We concept called Nells store Charleston, South Carolina, inspired British upbringing. It's pick-and-mix candy station, there's coffee fountain soda bar, nod Americana roots brand well. It's never easier shop online, asking customers come store, delivering experience makes worth it.

The home category still really big us now. But seems small comparison fashion doing. A new category recently launched swim – that's performing really well. We asked else customers wanted see Hill House, swim early answer.

The fashion world notoriously fickle. How ensure products remain relevant across changes fashion street?

We focus core customer, I'm worried what's relevant anyone except them. It easy fashion get caught trend cycle, core customer really focused cute clothes make feel great carry different things day. Within formula, deliver product makes happy focused constant cycle newness. It's building pieces last wardrobe.

I always talk putting mute button real life, too, something's serving way

What advice smaller businesses hoping expand build?

One important pieces advice I got I first starting keep blinders on. I remember constantly playing comparison game early days looking brands, Instagrams advertisements stores, thinking: ""We done done this, can't that?"" That never productive me.

Where see Hill House next years? Do think Nap Dress always centerpiece business?

My perception Nap Dress always hero product us. But growth right coming new products, categories retail channel. It's really exciting I think customers given us permission go rooms home activities they're swim outerwear.

I'm also incredibly bullish retail. I would love open stores. We're much one-year-at-a-time brand, I'd like start couple more. But customer led, I'll let tell us [what's next].

Nvidia reported $35.08 billion revenue versus consensus $33.13 billion. Beating data center revenue becoming common place Nvidia, yet what’s interesting data center segment posted largest surprise relative estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion revenue versus consensus $33.13 billion.





A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing consensus estimate $33.13 billion. This marks largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance data center sector. I/O Fund

Data center revenue $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates $1.95 billion. This marked largest beat since $2.46 billion beat Q2 FY24, well two $1.8 billion beats Q3 FY24 Q1 FY25. This important beat driven solely Hopper – seventh quarter H100s H200s.

Blackwell’s expected ramp quickly Q4 next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume Q4 could 150,000 200,000, tripling sequentially 550,000 Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter 2025). The expectation AI clusters go tens thousands, hundreds thousands, millions GPUs, indicating long runway Blackwell subsequent GPU generations.

Nvidia’s Blackwell Drive Minimum 50% Data Center Growth Next Year

What’s shaping 2025 convergence multiple strong tailwinds Nvidia capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters generation beginning upper end Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing increase past one quarter trillion (which covered two weeks ago), importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper.

Q3 earnings aside, bigger picture Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year far exceed GPU sales saw 2023 2024 — combined. 2025 shaping potentially important year Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis free stock newsletter November 2018 I/O Fund entered $3.15 returns 3,280%.

Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper delivered approximately $125 billion $130 billion data center revenue 2023 2024. Blackwell, hand, expected deliver $210 billion next year alone.

Back August, analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote:

‘According reports Wccftech: “Team Green expected ship 60,000 70,000 units NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, given one server reported cost around $2 million $3 million per unit, means Team Green bag around whopping $210 billion Blackwell servers along, year.

The weight report cannot overstated implies 26% upside 2025’s estimates based one SKU alone.”

Despite Blackwell yet shipping full volume, multiple data points support ramp $200+ billion revenue.

Perhaps important quote one could easily overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained Q3’s earnings “completed successful mask change Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments scheduled begin fourth quarter fiscal 2025 continue ramp fiscal 2026.”

Since Hopper Blackwell shipping tandem beginning Q4, there’s emphasis supply constraints moving forward, management clear saying products “certain supply constraints” Blackwell’s demand “expected exceed supply several quarters fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints nothing new it’s widely understood Blackwell already sold next year.

By executing mask change improve production yields, Nvidia theoretically get usable chips per wafer, alleviating supply fears allowing meet higher demand levels, leading higher revenue generation. Management already hinted this, saying “we deliver quarter Blackwells previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained GPU clusters Blackwell starting Hopper left off: “You see tail-end last generation foundation models 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts 100,000 Blackwells.”

Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line analysts' expectations $37.5 billion, still significant room Blackwell grow 2025. Current forecasts point revenue surpassing $50 billion-mark one year now, revenue growth excess 40% next five quarters.

A table displaying wide range analyst revenue estimates Nvidia FY26, highlighting ... [+] $40 billion range Q3 $70 billion range Q4. The potential Nvidia achieve $50 billion quarterly data center revenue also noted. I/O Fund

Interestingly, still massive disconnect analyst estimates FY26 progresses – estimates Q3 nearly $40 billion range low high estimates. When looking Q4 next year, ridiculous $70 billion range, analysts predicting $31 billion low end others estimates high $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain quarterly cadence beating $2 billion midpoint estimates, assuming data center mix remains ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 data center revenue >$50 billion/quarter, $200+ billion annualized compared data center revenue $140 billion year.

Big Tech’s capex supports revenue growth story, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Alphabet accelerated capex significantly past couple quarters reaffirmed need continue investing aggressively AI infrastructure moving 2025.

Additionally, Big Tech already spending tens billions Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup:

Alphabet reportedly ordered 400,000 GB200s worth $10 billion.

Microsoft reportedly ordered 60,000 GB200s worth $2 billion.

Meta reportedly ordered 360,000 GB200s worth $8 billion.

This fraction 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come ~$240 billion estimated $70 billion spent Q4, four currently tracking $270 billion capex predominantly AI infrastructure 2025.

Nvidia capturing lion’s share AI spending Big Tech, ~80% 85%, assuming little change AI GPU market share competition primarily arising AMD one else, Big Tech’s spending implies clear path towards $200 billion GPU revenue 2025.

The importance Big Tech’s capex also echoed CEO stating see $1 trillion data infrastructure rebuild expects see digestion hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe digestion modernize trillion dollars data centers.” That would imply another 3X remaining three-quarter trillion – stock price, capex. Presumably, would mean higher trajectory stock price terms valuing revenue.

Nvidia Faces Tough Comps Off Peak Growth

Hopper drove another beat, Nvidia becoming widely known for. It’s rare analysts openly expect large beats going print, yet UBS correctly tagged beat quarter $2 billion. However, due declining peak revenue growth 265% earlier year, Hopper-driven growth 94% drive stock next leg higher. Nvidia investors, myself, need Blackwell’s pricing power Blackwell’s clear demand signals re-invigorate stock.

Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, 10 points higher consensus estimates ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia lapping peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 Q1 FY25, revenue peaked 265% growth due Hopper ramping tremendously fast.

Growth technically decelerating nearly 30 points Q3 growth decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, reporting 93% YoY almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps still strong report say least.

A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing deceleration peak growth ... [+] 265% current growth 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats analyst estimates, driven Hopper, anticipated future impact Blackwell. I/O Fund

For Q4, management guided revenue $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, slightly ahead consensus estimates $37.02 billion midpoint. Analysts expecting $38.01 billion revenue Q4, week report, upper end guided range. Both Hopper Blackwell shipping tandem moving forward Blackwell ramps significantly fiscal 2026.

Margins Issues Overblown

Analysts nitpicking margins, yet concern overblown. Q3’s margins relatively line guidance despite $2 billion top-line beat, Q4, management forecast margins contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress clear following Blackwell, gross margin eventually return current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, expect gross margins moderate low-70s. When fully ramped, expect Blackwell margins mid-70s.”

Investors never underestimate Wall Street’s ability miss bigger picture. Analysts call cross-examined 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia operating margin 60% compared Mag 7 operating margins half that. It’s also completely normal semiconductors feel margin pressures initial stages ramping new product, especially scale pace.

GAAP gross margin 74.6% Q3, ahead guidance 74.4%. Adjusted gross margin 75%, line guidance. This reiterated view last quarter Q1 peak gross margins, margins contracted 380 bp since then.

For Q4, management guided GAAP gross margin 73%, +/- 0.5%, adjusted gross margin 73.5%, +/- 0.5%, sequential contraction ~150-160 bp.

For Q4, similar gross margins, management guided sequential contraction based operating expense forecasts. GAAP operating margin implied 60.2%, adjusted operating margin implied 64.4%, 200 bp sequential contraction.

Conclusion

The bigger picture Nvidia moving forward Blackwell holds potential dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation fewer quarters. Breaking CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory continue due two words: pricing power I quite vocal prior earnings Q3’s report nothing blip longer-term picture, 2025 much important quarterly report.

The thoroughness needed, however, rumors media short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, 2025 approaches, supply chain data giving bullish signals new generation GPUs shipping full volume mid-2025 (and beginning ship January quarter) far exceed GPU sales saw 2023 2024 combined.

Regarding firm’s confidence tracking supply chain data, The Information stated Nvidia experiencing material delay next generation GPUs, going far state Taiwan Semiconductor machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted report based supply chain data firm tracking. Those data points continue indicate Blackwell ramping. Here I stated:

“As now, there’s disconnect next fiscal year’s revenue estimates $167 billion $210 billion GB200s alone expected ship next year. Perhaps analysts waiting signals supply chain produce outsized orders. So far, good signals see TSMC SMCI’s recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, well.”

Fast forward two months, next year’s fiscal estimates stand $185 billion $167 billion; showing material impact delay (quite opposite). Our firm also able use supply chain data buy Nvidia July/August, average cost basis $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade $3.15, actively track stock publish real-time trade alerts anyone feels missed AI juggernaut.

$5B+ Blackwell Revenue Q4

The first item determine strength upcoming earnings report Nvidia nothing Q3 results. Rather, market want know much Blackwell revenue expected January quarter. Morgan Stanley estimates placed $5 $6 billion, number hitting ceiling due supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, $5 billion $8 billion.

The bigger picture Blackwell ramp order magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper delivered approximately $125 billion data center revenue since Q1 2023, based estimates Trend Force placing Hopper generating 90% data center revenue 2024. Blackwell, hand, expected deliver $210 billion next year alone, based estimates 60,000 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced $3 million each.

Given company lapping tough comparables, growth rate slow considerably even Blackwell ramp $6 billion per quarter $60 billion per quarter late-2026 (Hopper seventh quarter Blackwell seventh quarter late 2026). This excellence begets excellence, thus, Nvidia competing new generation GPUs. For example, Hopper, company reported peak quarterly growth 262% 265% earlier year, yet expected slow mid-40% growth close 2025.

Nvidia multiple levers pull outside forces play help maintain 40%+ growth rate. This includes 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite AI spending, long-term AI GPU market growth Enterprises Consumer, plus commanding market share position.

By coming market upgraded, powerful GPUs now-annual cadence, Blackwell Ultra, Rubin Rubin Ultra soon come, Nvidia continue largest beneficiary Big Tech’s AI capex unprecedented degree company continually raises bar performance TCO upgrades new generation.

Additionally, Nvidia software moat CUDA cash reserve chip capacity bulk fab level maintain 80% 85% share executives foresee $500 billion AI accelerator market 2028. I first covered points free newsletter I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap 2030.”

Of points, one visible Nvidia continues pry away tens billions cash – hundreds billions —- world’s leading tech companies.

Big Tech Capex Surpass Quarter Trillion

All roads lead Nvidia, it’s secret Big Tech others competing purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex proxy Nvidia demand 2022, tracking quarterly basis starting early 2023 – help gauge AI demand, I continue track Big Tech capex quarterly closely readers.

Our recent checks published analysis “AI Spending Exceed Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal AI spending continues accelerate, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta track increase spend ~$90 billion YoY 2024. This include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle dozens others also spending multiple billions Nvidia’s GPUs, well.

To better understand trajectory AI spending, let’s take step back 2023, rapid ascent ChatGPT beginning year set stage AI step spotlight.

In first half 2023, Big Tech spent ~$74 billion capex. Through Q3, sum moved ~$109 billion.

In first half 2024, Big Tech spent nearly $104 billion, 47% YoY increase. Through Q3, sum surged $170 billion, 56% YoY.

Big Tech could spend another $70 billion Q4, based guidance comments executives, overwhelmingly discussed need AI infrastructure, putting full year capex ~$240 billion, nearly 15% higher level tracking start year.

Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total ... [+] ~$240B, 15% early-year estimates! I/O Fund

For 2025, Big Tech already signaled willingness spend substantially AI. There clear ROI Amazon, Google Microsoft rush meet elevated demand continues outpace AI capacity cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech large enterprises racing develop broaden AI services models. UBS projects Big Tech spend ~10% YoY, placing AI-driven capex $267 billion; however, 2024 sign, estimate low. This fits longer-term projections Bank America sees cumulative $700 billion spent AI 2026.

Nvidia Has Over 2X Better Margins Compared Most Mag 7 Stocks

As go lull Hopper generation seventh quarter, Blackwell yet shipping volume, firm buying dips Nvidia many reasons – one it’s market leader margins. By near monopoly GPUs, Nvidia incredibly strong pricing power.

The GPUs coming 2025, called Blackwell, set intensify pricing power DGX B200 systems reportedly going 40%+ premium previous DGX H100 systems, $500,000 per server versus low $300,000s per server, respectively.

While GB200 prices estimated $60,000 $70,000 single chip, NVL36 NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, NVL36 expected cost ~$1.8 million, 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), comes $100,000 per GB200 additional components. For NVL72, works ~$83,333 per GB200 additional components.

While concerns Nvidia’s margins given management guided sequential contraction gross margins Q3, sheer pricing power Blackwell ultimately non-issue next year.

Nvidia’s operating margin 62% exceeds second place Microsoft 17.5 points third place Meta 21.9 points; Nvidia double rest Mag 7 including Apple Alphabet. This Hopper’s pricing power versus Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute Networking operating margin expanded 28.5% Q3 FY23 Hopper reached full production 71.3% recent quarter even revenue grew 7x seven-quarter period.

Nvidia leads MAG 7 62% operating margin, driven Hopper’s pricing power—more ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, others group! YCharts

Nvidia expected report roughly 50 bps 100 bps margin contraction quarter compared last quarter, see roughly 200 bps 300 bps margin contraction peak growth quarters earlier year. As stated, pricing power I foresee Blackwell keep margins strong well 2025, therefore, concerns margins quarter moot point next year.

The strong margins combined expected growth AI accelerators caused analysts increase earnings per share substantially late. Bank America increased EPS estimates next calendar year $3.90 $4.47 calendar year 2026 $4.72 $5.67.

In February, I wrote analysis describing Nvidia’s valuation “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” help readers prepare higher return coming months, detailed importance revisions.

Ultimately, revisions make stock cheaper leads room bottom-line valuation. Despite fairly straight forward, velocity revisions single important point short sellers Nvidia critics cannot seem understand.

Q3 Earnings Details:

Of quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, quarter likely lackluster. This impact Hopper H200s well-known Blackwell generation won’t shipping volume Q1 ramping Q2.

I looking forward fiscal year guide February call, even excited May earnings call Blackwell’s impact better understood.

Nvidia’s Q3 FY2025 Revenue:

Nvidia expected report revenue $32.9 billion growth 81.8% midpoint. Analyst expectations higher management guidance $32.5 billion midpoint, growth 79.4%. This deceleration last quarter’s 122.4% growth, peak growth 262% 265% April January 2024 quarters.

As pointed EPS, another area Nvidia unique sheer amount analyst revisions stock. It speaks Nvidia’s dominance AI data center continually surprise Street, also challenge analysts face terms predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge.

For example, year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia report 33.4% revenue growth quarter expected 81.8% growth, revisions total 48.4 points six months’ time (more double original growth expectations).

This quarter, wide range expectations UBS believing Nvidia beat much $2 billion, revenue $34.5 billion $35 billion Q3. Piper Sandler foresees beat $1.3 billion Q3, beat $1.5 billion Q4.

It’s quite clear past two years analysts know gauge growth coming company. In 2025, Blackwell likely wildly exceed analyst estimates again.

EPS:

This quarter, analysts expecting EPS $0.74 compared EPS $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, company beaten EPS estimates 10% more, yet last quarter, beat muted 5.7%.

On topic Nvidia 2X better margins Mag 7, glimpse Nvidia compares EPS 35%+ growth rate compared Mag 7 reporting half growth rate 2026:

Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR

Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR

Supply Constraints:

This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, offer full year guide yet address elephant room — supply constraints.

The fab makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), working overtime boost capacity meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity estimated ~15,000/month end 2023, originally expected triple ~45,000 50,000/month end 2024 order meet high demand Nvidia, AMD advanced node clients. Now, capacity expected rise ~300% 60,000/month.

TSMC remains committed significantly boosting CoWoS capacity next years order accommodate accelerated AI GPU timelines Nvidia AMD, multiple different product lines expected come market next couple years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity estimated 80,000 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, Nvidia reportedly already reserving half capacity.

By end 2026, CoWoS capacity estimated expand much 140,000 150,000/month, representing 10x growth capacity end 2023.

Foxconn Quanta also signaling strong demand Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn said see “crazy” demand Blackwell servers, forecast AI servers make half overall server business 2025. Foxconn said initial shipments time Q4 ramping much faster Q1, Quanta saying same, initial shipments schedule ramp Q1.

Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth next year back strong demand, Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying “recent capex guidance top US hyperscalers also confirmed aggressive spending AI 2025, high base 2024.”

Nvidia’s China Exposure Low

Nvidia subject severe export restrictions US due integral role advancing AI computing. Subsequently, company’s China exposure among lowest semiconductor sector, leaving less exposed see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs.

Nvidia’s China revenue 9.6% Q1 12.2% Q2, low-20% range quarters fiscal 2024. For FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue 16.9%, 21.5% year prior. Other semi peers much heavily exposed China: Broadcom’s China exposure 32.2% FY 2023, Intel’s exposure 27%, Qualcomm Marvell 40% revenue stem China FY 2024.

Semiconductor Peers Quite Weak

Although Nvidia’s fundamentals perfect 10, stock contending weak peers, evidenced major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX SMH, making new highs S&P 500.

Retail investors often find hard way, even perfect stock must contend market forces beyond control. This primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback Nvidia holding semiconductor market, grown unusually weak past weeks. SOXX 20% all-time highs SMH 14% all-time highs despite S&P 500 making new highs. In 1-hour webinar I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed issue AI investors I’d like see I resume buying Nvidia.

Conclusion:

As approach 2024 holiday season, businesses—particularly small medium enterprises (SMEs)—must prepare time heightened opportunity potential challenges. The National Retail Federation expects consumers spend 2.5% 3.5% holiday season last year.

To succeed critical period, companies need aware key trends, anticipate shifts consumer behavior equip handle increased demand. By focusing flexibility, operational readiness customer satisfaction, businesses could find great success mitigating risks. Here’s businesses need know ensure successful holiday season.

Prepare increased demand flexibility operations.

The holiday season, especially events like Black Friday Cyber Monday, brings significant surge e-commerce activity. In fact, based company's internal data, forecast volume increase 40% compared regular operating days, peak days like December 23 expected see 50% rise shipments.

To handle surge, businesses need ensure supply chains flexibly scale operations. Whether it’s managing inventory, scheduling extra delivery fleets hiring additional staff, operational flexibility key meeting customer expectations.

Monitor global supply chain challenges.

Supply chain disruptions create headaches peak season, businesses must stay ahead potential issues. From unpredictable weather patterns last-minute changes consumer behavior, external factors lead capacity constraints delays.

Businesses closely monitor supply chains work logistics providers offer agile solutions, additional shipping capacity alternative transportation routes. Leaders engage regular dialogue logistics partners understand emerging risks align contingency plans. Emphasizing real-time data sharing also improve responsiveness make adjustments easier conditions evolve.

To able adapt quickly unexpected changes maintaining high levels service quality, businesses also cultivate network reliable providers consider diverse transportation options.

Focus customer experience communication.

Today’s consumers high expectations, particularly holiday season timely delivery seamless experiences essential. A recent survey Radial reveals 29% consumers anticipate receiving holiday orders within two three days.

Businesses must prioritize clear communication, especially around shipping deadlines, delivery delays potential stock shortages. Providing transparency offering customers multiple delivery options—such expedited shipping flexible return policies—can go long way building trust retaining loyalty.

Additionally, SMEs take proactive approach managing customer stress busy time. Offering responsive customer service, including access support channels like live chat social media, help mitigate frustration enhance overall shopping experience.

Leverage e-commerce international growth.

Despite global economic challenges, many SMEs remain optimistic potential e-commerce growth holiday season. In fact, many companies company's 2024 E-Commerce Survey expect e-commerce sales increase year-over-year, social commerce expected reach approximately $2 trillion 2025. Moreover, international growth presents significant opportunity, markets like EU, UK, Mexico Canada offering new customer bases businesses tap into.

Diversifying international markets opens revenue streams also helps businesses spread risk reducing reliance one region. Companies consider adjusting marketing strategies target international audiences ensure prepared navigate cross-border logistics compliance.

Incorporate sustainable solutions.

Sustainability becoming increasingly important consumers, especially holiday season shopping spikes. Another recent study company found 59% U.S. online shoppers consider sustainability ""very"" ""quite"" important. This presents unique challenge peak season, businesses must manage heightened demand aligning consumer values.

By offering transparency around sustainability efforts providing greener packaging delivery options businesses differentiate crowded market.

AI transforming industries, reshaping consumers, founders leaders approach business operations—especially supply chains. While AI holds great potential improving efficiency, many companies face challenges integration due technical organizational hurdles. In post, we'll explore AI's impact supply chains, applications companies begin leveraging it, addressing key questions throughout.

What Is AI?

Before diving deeper, essential understand AI. It simulates human intelligence machines perform tasks like learning, problem-solving decision-making. It includes technologies machine learning, natural language processing computer vision enhance efficiency across industries.

According Statista, AI market grew $184 billion 2024, rise nearly $50 billion 2023. This rapid expansion expected continue, market projected exceed $826 billion 2030.

How AI Can Shape The Future Of Supply Chain Management

Having worked closely decade within supply chain industry, I've observed several ways AI transform supply chain landscape. In opinion, personalized AI assistants huge potential reshape supply chain leaders manage complex operations. Let's break down:

1. Distributed Communication With Suppliers

Traditionally, supply chain leaders would manually handle interactions multiple suppliers, time-consuming error-prone process. AI assistants could automate interactions, coordinating suppliers across regions real time.

For example, shipment delay occurs, AI assistant instantly engage suppliers, propose alternative shipping options ensure alignment revised timelines. This ensures standardized communication usage consistent language terms, reducing risk miscommunication.

2. Automated Order Operations

By replacing manual purchase order (PO) creation AI-driven automation order management, supply chain leaders simply prompt AI assistants commands like, ""Create PO 500 units Supplier X,"" AI pull relevant data pricing, order history terms—generating sending PO instantly.

In high-volume industries like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) personal care, automation helps teams manage complex procurement needs efficiently—ensuring meet tight deadlines adapt changing demand.

3. No-Code Reporting

No-code reporting empower supply chain leaders access data insights without technical expertise. AI assistants generate customized reports based simple prompts, like, ""Show cost savings supplier quarter"" or, ""Analyze environmental impact last 10 shipments."" This instant access insights enables faster, data-driven decisions, improving supplier performance, order accuracy sustainability tracking.

4. Risk Mitigation

Leveraging historical demand plans baseline, AI forecast risks supplier delays, stock shortages transportation disruptions. By analyzing demand trends, AI predict potential risks materialize, allowing supply chain leaders proactively adjust procurement strategies.

For example, AI predicts surge demand certain products, recommend adjusting inventory levels expediting orders suppliers.

Challenges Implementing AI

As CPO Suuchi, I've observed supply chain leaders industries like FMCG OEM facing challenges implementing AI. Across industries, common challenges include outdated systems, data silos internal resistance change despite AI's proven ability enhance efficiency profitability.

For example, FMCG aggregator worked sought leverage AI reduce costs improve margins struggled fragmented data across multiple systems. The inflexible ERP system complicated efforts, real-time integration AI-driven insights required custom development, delaying projected 4% reduction landed costs 3% margin improvements.

Similarly, cosmetics company sought use AI reduce lead times improve order accuracy. However, integrating AI customized manual order management system proved challenging. Technical limitations employee resistance slowed goal cutting lead times 30% reducing order errors 45%, delaying quicker product launches.

A Guide To AI Integration For Businesses

To fully maximize AI's benefits, organizations must encourage employee adoption. Here key strategies optimizing AI supply chains:

Supply Chain Assessment

Conduct comprehensive assessment supply chain implementing AI. Determine areas improvement supply chain. To optimize effectiveness AI technology, must create constantly adhere goals.

Understand The Business Model

The starting point AI integration different businesses often based respective business models. For instance, AI implementation e-commerce business enhances efficiency products, detects fraud, provides personalized experiences, assists customers automatically adjusts prices according market trends. Meanwhile, manufacturers implement AI enhance efficiency minimize disruption using predictive maintenance, automated production, real-time defect detection data-driven demand forecasting.

Implement A Data Strategy

The majority AI tools supply chain use prediction analytics, needs proper data. Ensure information well-organized, pristine accurate. It may entail reconciliation disparate datasets, correction inaccuracies identification external variables may affect supply chain.

Adapt A Phased Approach

Consider gradual approach AI integration supply chain. Launch trial project emphasizes specific issue improving operational efficiency warehouse identifying indicators client demand. It allows evaluate effectiveness AI, acquire knowledge obtain essential information broader rollout.

Consider Professional Collaboration

Installing AI supply chain software independently may yield lower ROI. Collaborating professionals help set tangible goals, ensuring organizations effectively measure witness return investment.

Conclusion

AI revolutionizes supply chains enhancing transparency, efficiency risk management. Strategic integration expert collaboration key maximizing benefits.

With resolution U.S. East Coast port strike, shippers may experience temporary sense relief, logistical hurdles far over. The immediate focus clearing significant backlog shipments, could take weeks continue strain freight capacities. Elevated freight costs ongoing congestion primary alternative ports means delays persist, affecting inventory replenishment supply chain reliability businesses prepare critical holiday season. However, bigger issue — elephant room — automation, kicked road now. By postponing integration advanced technologies port operations, nation risks undermining competitiveness efficiency global stage. This hesitation hampers modernization ports also presents significant risk companies considering onshoring operations. If domestic logistics infrastructure cannot evolve meet modern demands, businesses may seek efficient environments elsewhere, leading potential economic loss. To foster economic growth maintain competitive edge, imperative address automation proactively, finding balance advances technological adoption considering workforce's needs.

Director North American Ocean Shipping C.H. Robinson

The U.S. port strike ended, impacts far over. A week disruption typically leads least month delays ports, delays increase move inland. As seen past, port congestion dwell time increases, equipment tied longer rates tend increase equipment availability decreases. Keep mind, U.S. Southeast also still recovering Hurricane Helene. While truckload capacity currently remains steady available across impacted regions, load-to-truck ratios rising West Coast. We expect continue rail delays linger, elevating need trucks transloading services. Air freight expedited LCL services likely continue play role helping move priority freight market recovers.

So, expect truck rate spike spot (~10%), slightly higher labor overtime warehouses transloading centers. For weeks leading strike, many importers routed containers West Coast ports. There already imbalance empty containers across ports, add imbalance, resulting empty container movements West Eastern shipper locations takes additional spot freight capacity away also might impact container availability shippers.
